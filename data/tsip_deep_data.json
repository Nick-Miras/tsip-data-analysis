        "description": "Nyakaziba small scale mining is located in Nyakaziba  Village in Bihanga Subcounty in Bushenyi District. Mining is done in a hilly area at the footslopes. All activities such as almagamation sorting are done close to the highly saturated valley that drains  into the nearby wetland system at footslope in undulating terrain. It is estimated that approximately 40 households (200 people including Children and women)  are involved in this activity. The operations typically rely on rudimentary methods and technology and are usually performed by miners who lack economic capital. Mercury- gold amalgamations is an inexpensive, efficient and simple gold extraction method; it is the most common method employed in this area.  It is approximated that this process results in the discharge of large amounts of mercury and other contaminants into the adjacent aquatic ecosystems and the downstream environment.                Mine tailings and spills, particularly the amalgamation activity and sorting, in the areas are a significant sources of pollutants. These contaminate the adjacent water sources and spread into further environments.   ",

The soil where the tailings have accumulated seems to be affected and a strong metallic smell is perceived especially in the areas with the highest accumulation of sludge. The main pollutant is mercury, the migration route is caused by the accumulation of tailings that fall into the ravine and that in times of rain water currents are created that drain directly to the ravine. The main route of exposure is by ingestion of water from the creek which is a source of consumption of the surrounding population and by inhalation of particulate material by exposure of mining tailings with mercury and other pollutants in the open.  \n\nMina Gualconda ubicada en el municipio de Los Andes, cerca a la cabecera municipal de Sotomayor, es un sitio en el que se ha realizado extracci\u00f3n de oro desde 1975 aplicando mercurio como t\u00e9cnica de amalgamiento.

        "description": "The Gualconda mine is located in the municipality of Los Andes in the department of Nari\u00f1o. The mine is located in a mountainous area, it has a strongly undulating topography with an inclined slope. Tons of tailings with mercury have been deposited on the site for more than 4 decades. A part of the tailings has been contained in sacks, but another important fraction has been dispersed in piles in a sensitive area, very close to the Honda ravine. In the piles of tailings that were deposited on the bank of the ravine, the trace of the fall of these wastes towards the body of water is observed. The tailings are not covered, generating large discharges in times of rain and important ponds that re-transform the tailings into muds (liquids) of difficult handling which leads to drainage processes towards the ravine and the interior soil profiles. The contamination has spread to more than one medium, that is, a source of water and surroundings of the area with vegetation that has been partially eroded. In addition, the natural soil surface has been modified by a compacted soil, full of tailings. In the tailings sedimentation tank there is a strong metallic smell. The Honda ravine is the main source of water consumption for 20 families in summer and at least 200 families use it for irrigation of their agriculture. Less than 2 years ago, the workers of the Gualconda mine moved the sifted ore to their homes and in the kitchen they carried out the smelting of gold, which still contained traces of mercury. According to the results of the XRF, a high concentration of lead and arsenic is presented as secondary metals that are extracted in the mercury amalgam mining process. Draws attention to the high concentrations of As, Pb and Hg in the Honda ravine and in areas around the vegetation and fruit trees.  La mina Gualconda se localiza en el municipio de los Andes del departamento de Nari\u00f1o. La mina est\u00e1 ubicada en zona monta\u00f1osa, posee una topograf\u00eda fuertemente ondulada con pendiente inclinada. En el sitio se han depositado por m\u00e1s de 4 d\u00e9cadas toneladas de relaves con mercurio. Una parte de los relaves se ha contenido en sacos, pero otra fracci\u00f3n importante se ha dispersado en montones en una zona sensible, muy cerca de la quebrada Honda. En los montones de relaves que se depositaron a la orilla de la quebrada se observa la huella de ca\u00edda de estos residuos hacia el cuerpo de agua. Los relaves no est\u00e1n cubiertos, generando grandes vertimientos en \u00e9pocas de lluvia y encharcamientos importantes que re-transforman los relaves en lodos (l\u00edquidos) de dif\u00edcil manejo lo cual conlleva a procesos de drenaje hacia la quebrada y los perfiles interiores del suelo.  La contaminaci\u00f3n se ha esparcido a m\u00e1s de un medio, esto es, fuente de agua y alrededores de la zona con vegetaci\u00f3n que se ha erosionado parcialmente. Adem\u00e1s la superficie natural del suelo se ha modificado por un suelo compactado, lleno de relaves. En el tanque de sedimentaci\u00f3n de relaves se presenta un olor fuertemente met\u00e1lico. La quebrada Honda es la principal fuente de consumo de agua para 20 familias en \u00e9pocas de verano y al menos 200 familias la usan para irrigaci\u00f3n de su agricultura.

        "description": "During the Somali civil war in the late 1980s the Somaliland city of Hargeisa was extensively bombed from the air.  During this time the Desert Locust Control Organisation (DLCO) site near the city was also bombed and largely destroyed.  At that time it is reported that around 81,000 litres of various pesticides that were stored at the site leaked or were deliberately tipped on to the ground during subsequent looting.  The following pesticides were believed to have been stored at the site at that time: aldrin/dieldrin, hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH, BHC or lindane), and fenitrothion.  The former storage site covers an area 100m x 90m and is now almost fully enclosed by a 3m high concrete block wall with a steel doorway entrance.  This is further enclosed on 3 sides by a second perimeter wall that encloses the DLCO compound.  The storage site is situated centrally on the northern perimeter of the DLCO compound.  The former storage site appears to have been completely destroyed during the bombing, only the remains of 1 wall and a partial concrete floor slab are evident.   The surface of the site is covered in debris, rubble and the remains of the pesticide drums.  In a few places surface discoloration was observed indicating high levels of contamination remain.  There is a persistent odour of pesticide in and around the former storage area also indicating high levels of contamination.  It is likely that most of the pesticide stocks would have been stored within this central area prior to the bombing.  However, given the level of destruction material could have been spread over a large area.  At the time of the visit the remains of drums and other pesticide handling equipment were visible within and outside the compound, including in the dry riverbed around 100m from the northern perimeter.    The DLCO site is located approximately 5km south of the administrative centre of Hargeisa.  The site itself is situated at the head of the Ayaha valley on the north facing slopes.  A dry riverbed lies only a few metres to the west of the former storage area and this carries rainwater during wet periods.  The river follows the valley northwards for around 1.2km where it drains into the Malka Durduru before joining the Mariojeh river around 3 km from the site.    Around 500m north along a dirt road is the now disused Ayaha Primary School.  At around 1km north of the site this road crosses the river and continues to the outskirts of Hargeisa around 2.5km from the site.  The valley has been occupied by returning refugees from the civil war.  At the time of the visit the nearest temporary dwelling was around 500m down the valley from the site.  Following the recommendations made by KEPHIS local government and UNDP are working to relocate people living in the valley and to complete the repairs to the site perimeter wall suggested.  At the time of the visit this work was approaching completion, as was the covering of the main contaminated site with a metal-pitched roof.  However, during the visit children and grazing animals were still getting in to the DLCO compound through the uncompleted wall.       The data indicate that these pesticides have spread at least 150m and possibly as far as 900m from the area originally effected.  These pesticides, especially dieldrin and lindane, are persistent in the soil environment and can be transported  by rainwater and the wind. Additionally, during this visit, it was found that children still make their way into the contaminated site.   ",

These pollutants affect soils and rivers, which serve as a source of drinking water and food for the population.  Huepetuhe is located in the Huepetuhe District, Manu province, in the Department of Madre de Dios. This village is at approximately 1400 km from Lima, but transport is only available by air and river.  The community is located in a mountainous area with many trees, with temperatures as high as 40 degrees and torrential rain. The houses are wooden with tin roofs and are seated on wooden pillars. Other huts are made of palm branches and covered with plastic, with no walls and only one room. The population only has electricity for 4 hours a day. In the area, there are 2 primary schools and one secondary school. They have a health post, but it lacks diagnostic equipment. The population of Huepetuhe lacks safe drinking water, drainage pipes, and garbage collection services.  Near the houses, in the mountains, are various mining activities, most of which are informal and artisanal. Some of these belongs to the Inversur company.   In this place, the miners are extracting gold using many chemicals, such as mercury and hydrocarbons. The waste generated from these chemicals is disposed into the environment and now is affecting the quality of soils and rivers in the area. Mining in the area produces about 20 kg of gold per day, which annually generates over 400 tons of tailings, causing damage to the population, especially in the rainy season.  Gold mining in the area is causing great harm to the ecosystem in the Amazonian jungle. Also, as the fishes and other small organisms feed on the soil and water, mercury is accumulating in their tissue, making them a danger to eat.  The population of Huepetuhe is also affected because they use the river water for drink and irrigation. Also, 40% of the population in the area works in the mines during the weekends and during periods of rain. Moreover, people in the area have reported a high incidence of diseases such as anemia and gastric problems.                    Water, soil, air, and food.  Primarily through drinking the water and using contaminated water for irrigation.                  ",

        "description": "Idrija was once home to one of the largest mercury mines in the world. After 500 years of operation, and after having produced 107,000 tons, or 13 percent of the world production of mercury, the mine has been closed due to low mercury prices and ore exhaustion.   Because of the mine's operation, this small town in the municipality of Idrija, within the Gori\u00c5\u00a1ka region, has become very polluted. The mercury content in soil, water, and air is high.   In some parts of the town, the concentrations of mercury vapors in air have reached up to 120 ng/m3. In individual houses built on the remains of ore-smelting residues, radon concentrations have surpassed 1,000 Bq/m3.   Even after the shutdown of the mine, mercury concentrations in the town's air continued to be high (50 to 290 ng/m3). Mercury concentrations in some plants in the Idrija area are still very high (14.6 ng/g dry weight) despite the mine's closure. Fish from the Idrijca River also continue to show high mercury bioaccumulation. Of the twelve million tons of mercury ore that were mined, it has been estimated that more than one quarter was dissipated into the environment. Estimated \"losses\" (emissions to air, river and soil) are about 37,000 tons of mercury.   Today, tailings and contaminated soils in the Idrija region are eroded and serve as a continuous source of mercury pollution, especially in the nearby Gulf of Trieste.                      People are still exposed to mercury through the air, drinking water, soil, and contaminated fish.  There are two major exposure pathways for the local population. One is the exposure to atmospheric Hg in Idrija and nearby  surroundings and the other is exposure through food consumption, including fish in the coastal area of the Gulf of Trieste. Today the highest values of Hg in air are still close to the US EPA reference concentrations for chronic inhalation exposure of 0.4 \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdg.m-3. This indicates that some inhabitants in more exposed areas of the town of Idrija are potentially at risk due to exposure to elemental mercury through inhalation. Exposure to inorganic Hg through food consumption other than fish is not considered to pose significant problems. On the contrary, the coastal population shows increased values of Hg in hair (Ingrao et al., 1993) as an indication of exposure to MeHg due to fish consumption.      ",

        "description": "Baku Steel Company is located in the Binagadi District of Baku Administrative region, in the north part of Baku city. The factory was constructed in 1969 as the main steel production plant in the South Caucasus. It was an important producer for the oil machinery industry in Azerbaijan, which was the main oil machinery producer in the former Soviet Union. The technology used in the plant is outdated in old. Some of machinery was imported from Germany in the end 19th century and is still used. These machines were brought here from other plants.  It is still the main producer of the steel in Azerbaijan.   Carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide are the main contaminants from this source. Carbon monoxide is a toxic gas without color, taste and odor. It inhibits the blood's ability to carry oxygen to vital organs such as the heart and brain. Short term exposure in low concentration for 2-3 hours may cause slight headache, tiredness, fatigue, nausea and dizziness. High concentrations (e.g. 1600 ppm) for 1 hour can cause death. There is little information regarding long-term exposure in low concentrations. According to local doctors, such exposures may cause blood and lung cancer. Azerbaijan State Statistical Committee informs that over the past 10 years, the number of local people ill with lung cancer increased nearly two times. We have official information of the ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources about the level of carbon monoxide.  When close to the site, one notices the smell of rotten eggs, an indicator of SO2. The area where the site is located is also heavily polluted by other sources. Because the climate is dry, long-term droughts easily cause dust that is mixed with SO2, which may cause respiratory diseases. SO2 is poisonous and irritates the respiratory system of humans. Investigators  assumed that rains after long droughts may easily cause acid rains which may contain H2SO4. That is why investigators took soil samples from the area.  Baku is a city, where North winds dominate. Because this site is located in North of Baku, the contaminants are easily blown south and diffuse through the atmosphere of the city.  The area is believed to be contaminated by a number of other sources and may be dangerous for human habitation.     In order to measure pollution, investigators took an air sample, mixed it with water and measured the resulting pH level that was 4,2. This is an indicator of air pollution.   On August 25, 2012, investigators attended a meeting with the Ministry of Environment, where an official of the ministry talked about health impacts of this site. He talked about different options that may be implemented. Recently there is strong recognition from the Government that the site should be closed.       ",

        "description": "Tangra, lying on the outskirts of Calcutta, was famous for its leather tanning industry (523 units). In 2001 and 2002, in response to a public interest litigation lawsuit alleging that pollution from the industries exceeded the State pollution standards, the Supreme Court order forced the tanneries to relocate to a self-contained leather-processing complex in the Bantala area. However some tanneries are still in Tangra despite relocation orders.   \"The West Bengal Government is planning to declare the Bantala Leather Complex as a notified area. A notified area is any land area which has been earmarked by legal provisions. The reasons given for doing this by the Chief Minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Secretariat is that doing so will enable an authority to look after its infrastructure and impose taxes on units operating there. The 1,300-acre Calcutta Leather Complex, around 14km from Science City, is presently administered by a state-appointed panel. The state government wants to set up a notified authority for the complex that will have statutory powers to collect taxes and other user charges and can administer the area in a smooth and orderly manner,\" said an official of the industries department. Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharyya said: \"I have heard about the proposal... but things haven't moved much. If the conversion happens, we will have to empower the body with powers of raising revenue. For that, legislative sanction will be necessary.\" The state had joined hands with a private firm, ML Dalmia & Company, to set up the leather complex in the mid-1990s after the Supreme Court had ordered tanneries out of the city. The tanneries started shifting from 2004. But with complaints of mismanagement pouring in, the state decided to hand over the administration of the complex to a new authority by declaring it a notified area. The functioning of the state panel, which doesn't have resources to spend on infrastructure, has drawn criticism from various stakeholders, including the tannery owners and the developers of the Rs 1,500-crore project.  The former tanneries had added their quota of filth to a city notorious for dirt and decay. The groundwater is suspected to be contaminated with hexavalent chromium from the tanneries. People may be exposed to the contaminant through fish and tubewells. Open gutters have a typical blue chromate color which is commonly utilized as a tanning agent. It is to be noted that Ward no 58 (Tangra, Tiljala)is the largest ward in Kolkata and it also happens to be the ward in which 99.98% of population are slum dwellers making them more vulnerable to the impacts of pollution. Again, according to a 1995 report of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, presence of chrome-based tanning among Kolkata tanners, with inappropriate wastewater drainage and collection systems, was causing serious environmental, health and hygiene problems. The report indicated that the highly congested habitations offered little or no scope for future expansion, modernisation or installation of effluent treatment plants.   Police, along with officials of the civic body, state pollution control board and CESC sealed 11 illegal tanneries in Tiljala, Topsia, Tangra and Karaya in December 2008. This news indicates that illegal taneries are still operating in Tangra.  The crackdown will continue until all the illegal tanneries have been sealed, said Ajey Ranade, the superintendent of South 24-Parganas police.  <p>Coordinates: Lat=22.5545340001, Lon=88.3840440001                   The groundwater is suspected to be contaminated with hexavalent chromium from the tanneries. People may be exposed to the contaminant by consuming fish in which it may have bio-accumulated.     ",

        "description": "Cebu City, the capital city of Cebu, is considered the second most significant metropolitan center in the Philippines. The city is located on the eastern shore of Cebu. Cebu is the Philippines' main domestic shipping port and is home to about 80 % of the country's domestic shipping companies and is a significant center of commerce, trade and industry in the Visayas and Mindanao regions. It has a population of about 2,439,005 people based on the 2007 Philippine Population census.  Cebu City has 81 barangays with a total population of 798,809 people (2007 census). Its trade and industry are based mainly on small and medium scale business enterprises and among these are Cebu Business Park and IT industries created by the Ayalas. In addition, export industries producing products such as semiconductors, electronic watches, electrical equipment, cameras and furniture are also booming in the region.  Another potential industry that may add to the economy of Cebu is the legal/formal recycling of IT materials and metals like ULAB. However, these types of industries are not yet common in the region.   For the entirety of the Visayas and Mindanao regions, there is only one registered ULAB facility, which is situated in Mandaue City. The high demand of recycling lead from ULAB has created an informal sector of ULAB recycling. Informal ULAB recycling poses hazards not only to the recyclers, but also to the community due to environmental contamination with heavy metals.  An informal ULAB recycling site was located in Sitio Tingga-an, Barangay San Nicolas, Cebu City. Barangay San Nicolas hosts 5,407 people based on 2007 Philippine Population Census, and of this, around 2000 people are possibly affected by lead and other heavy metals. According to the barangay health officer and some residents of Sitio Tingga-an, recycling is done usually within the community, by the roadside and outside of homes.   During our site visit we were able to witness the recycling done by the side of the road. Acids were directly dumped into sewers/canals and road cement. The recycling site is adjacent to a rice store/granary and opposite a school. Kids were playing in the vicinity, and many residents were eating here as well. Refreshments and other food vendors sell their products in this contaminated site.  The facility is a cottage industry in a shanty town that has operated for about 30 years, with about 40-60 families doing informal recycling over a 1 hectare area. Before that, a poultry operation was at the site. A school is across the street (about 75 meters away) with 200 elementary and 100 high school students.  There was a small old lead smelter along the street in front of the shanty town, behind a fence and a rice mill and warehouse is situated next door.  The lead is melted into pellets for buyers and used for galvanized iron sheet fasteners and to seal nail heads when nailing concrete.   According to the Barangay health officer, a health assessment was conducted by the University of the Philippines Manila about three to four years ago. Five children of those directly involved in the informal ULAB recycling and who were residing in the area for a long time were selected as respondents. Lead levels in their blood were examined and results showed that all of the respondents had blood lead levels exceeding health standards.  The DENR-EMB Region 7 and the Local Government Unit have already prohibited this economic activity. They have formed an enforcement team, but people continue ULAB recycling, as it is their source of income. There is more than one pathway. One is through the soil, as children may inhale lead dust while playing. Food contamination is also possible since sidewalk food vendors are in the vicinity. Rice stores/granaries are also present nearby thus displays of rice could be contaminated with lead dust.  Water could also be a pathway since some of the pipes for drinking water in the area are situated along these polluted canals.     ",

Lead levels in their blood were examined and results showed that all of the respondents had blood lead levels exceeding health standards.  Informal ULAB recyclers face hazards too, since they are not given personal protective gears.   The soil sample concentrations of arsenic, mercury, copper, and cadmium were compared to the United States' Centers for Disease Control minimum risk level (MRL) standards for toxic exposure. Using international standard values for the amount of soil an average weight 5 year old child ingests, calculations showed that all four metals exceeded MRL values for oral consumption of 100mg of soil for an 18.5 kg child per day. Mercury concentration just barely exceeded the MRL standard, copper had exceeded the MRL value by 3.7 times, and cadmium soil concentrations exceeded the MRL values by more than 33 times.  However, the most alarming value is of arsenic concentration, which exceeded the MRL value for chronic exposure by more than 668 times.  There are a number of limitations in these calculations, done retrospectively with the limited data available.  Primarily, this only accounts for the oral ingestion route of inadvertent soil intake by children, and no other exposure pathway (such as inhalation of fine particles.) Additionally, the average weight of children in the Philippines is likely lower than the given WHO standard.  Also, children living in this community likely eat more than just 100mg of dirt, the worldwide average value used in the calculations.  Therefore, it is likely that with sufficient data, computations would show that exposure in children is even greater than the values calculated here.  -U.S. CDC's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mrls/index.asp      ",

Thutipet is situated beside the Ambur and Pernumpet Road that goes via Gudiatham.   Ambur is located at 12\u00c2\u00b047\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2N 78\u00c2\u00b042\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2E12.78\u00c2\u00b0N 78.7\u00c2\u00b0E. It has an average elevation of 316 metres (1036 feet), and is extremely hot and dry during summer when temperature soars to as high as 43 degree C (110 F). The winter is cold and dry with dipping temperatures. Ambur is well connected by road, on the Chennai- Bangalore National Expressway, and by rail on the Chennai-Jolarpettai line with a number of express/superfast trains to Chennai, Bangalore, Coimbatore, Mysore, Erode, etc.  Factories in Ambur manufacture shoes for the world's leading footwear brand names like Floursheim, Lumberjack, Gabor, primigi, caterpillar, Clarks, Fretzmen, Coll Hann, Hi-Line, Hugo Boss, Marc, and many more. Hence, it is also known as a \"Leather City,\" and temperatures reach up to 10 degree C during the night. One of the problems that Ambur faces is polluted ground water, which is not potable. This happened due to the chemicals released by the leather tanneries directly into the most-of-the-time-dry Palar River traversing across Ambur before the Common Effluent Treatment Plants that use Reverse Osmosis process were installed. However, with strict measures taken by the State Government, most of the companies have now installed effluent treatment plants to treat the water from harsh chemicals such as hexavalent chromium, trivalent chromium, etc.    People from the area are exposed to the above contaminants through the consumption of food,vegetables,drinking water, and milk.

It is within the South Asian tropics climatic region.  The annual mean temperature is 21.4 degrees Celsius and the yearly average precipitation is 13,864 millimeters.      Guiyu Town is an electronic trash recycling city. Every day more than 100 freight vehicles filled with e-waste dump their loads in the town. Beilin village is not far away from Guiyu Town's center, it is located at the northwest of the town.  People resort to all means to obtain the used metal within the e-waste. The primary method is to burn down the worn out electric wire and cable with the sulfur acid water flushing the circuit wafer and burning trash piled up along the river.       In Beilin village, there is a constant haze of black smoke and there are shiny black ponds that emit a foul odor. Here, air was suffocated, river water was polluted, soil was poisoned. The serious contaminated ecological environment has also impaired villagers' health. Many labors were infected the respiratory disease, the skin presented ulcer, even had cancer.  Water, soil, food, air   e-waste is burned and then washed over with water, polluting both the air and the water (and the soil).  The water and soi, in turn, contaminate the food.  ",

        "description": "The area surrounding Amman Gharh, Nowshera, North West Frontier Province (NWFP), has been found to have high levels of DDT contamination from an abandoned DDT production facility.   Nowshera one of the largest cities of NWFP lies on the Grand Trunk Road 27 miles due east of Peshawar. It is located along the banks of River Kabul. It is also at the junction of Peshawar and Swat Road. Total area of the Nowshera District is 1748 square kilometers.  According to a 1998 report, the district has a population of 874,000 (urban population = 26%). Children under 15 years of age constitute 45% of the total population. There are numerous streams in the area  which are the only source of drinking water for many villages.  The historical city of Nowshera is located at a distance of 120km from Islamabad international airport and 48 km from Peshawar International airport.   The rivers in the District are the Kabul and Indus River. The Kabul River enters the village at its Western side and runs through plain and joins Indus River at Kund near Khairabad.  Climate is temperate. One can enjoy cold in winters and hot in summers. Summers are hot and humid with temperature range of 35-40 \u00c2\u00b0C. Winters are cold with varying temperature of 5 \u00c2\u00b0C to -1 \u00c2\u00b0C. But spring and autumn are pleasant and refreshing. The predominant wind direction is North East to South West.  There are big industries there, such as Paper International Ltd (previously known as Adam jee paper and board mill) Aman Garh, Nizampur Cement Company (AWT), Fauji Corn Complex at Jehangira, Nowshera Sheet Glass Industries at Adamzai, Pakistan Tobacco Company at Akora Khattak, Associated Industries Ltd. at Amangarh, Ferozsons pharmaceutical at Amangarh, Locomotive factory at Risalpur, and Special Export Processing Zone at Risalpur.  The contamination primarily resulted from DDT production in a local factory that was established in 1963 and remained in operation until 1994. The main factory drain led to the Kabul river and nearby villages. Studies have determined that both the water and soil in and around the factory area are still contaminated with DDT, despite the closure of the factory 12 years ago. The contamination within the factory area poses a threat to public health and the environment and has serious consequences to ecosystem functions, food safety, and other aspects of human health.  The area/soil may remain contaminated with DDT for some time and researchers have strongly recommended that the land near the factory should not be sold or put to use without prior approval from an environmental impact assessment of the DDT factory.   The annual production of the factory when in operation was about 6000 tons. In 1994, the factory was closed after ban on the use of 21 pesticides including DDT. But still the nauseating smell of DDT is clear as one nears this industry.  Most of the houses in the vicinity of the factory were found to be made of cement and stone bricks. The standards of living are not very high and mostly people are indulged in professions like factory labors, Government servants etc. Transportation is also a common business.    From the nominator:  \"The DDT factory and the site proposed for the present study are in Nowshera Peshawar, North West Frontier Province (NWFP), Pakistan (33o.10` to 34o.10` north latitudes and 71o.39` to 72o.16` east longitudes).    Data described in two SDPI reports indicates that 90.91% of the soil samples studied (90 soil samples in a half kilometer square area) were contaminated with DDT, with 66.6% of the samples indicating residual DDT levels higher than DDT minimum risk level in soil.\"        Humans can come in contact with DDT through contaminated air, soil, water and food.

DDT is persistent in nature and does not degrade in the environment by biological, physical, or chemical processes. Being non biodegradable, DDT can travel to long distances (thousands of kilometers ) and can accumulate in human bodies due to its solubility in fats. Even in very minute amounts DDT can injure human health and health of other organisms. It is harmful to stomach, intestines, liver and kidneys and can affect nervous system and can cause reproductive, development defects and cancer and tumors. It also causes learning disabilities in children. Women, children and infants are especially vulnerable to certain effects of DDT.    It is evident from the previous studies that both water and soil in the surrounding areas of the factory are contaminated by DDT, despite the fact the factory was closed more than a decade before. Keeping in view the persistency, non biodegradability, environmental impacts of DDT in and around the factory area pose serious threat to the public health and environment.  Fetus and unborn babies are badly affected by absorption of the accumulated DDT in the fats of their parents bodies.        ",
        "notes": "DDT (Dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane) is one of the most hazardous groups of chemicals called Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), also known as \"The Dirty Dozen\". These very toxic chemicals, including DDT are long lasting due to their non-degradability, can travel to distant places and being fat soluble, accumulate in animals and human bodies. Even in extremely small amounts, POPs cause adverse impacts on human health and environment.   To save public health, especially the health of the children, the manufacturing and use of POPs has been banned in the world under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), enacted in 2001. A number of national governments including Pakistan have signed the Stockholm Convention. The Convention has been ratified by over 120 countries thus far. Due to the persistent nature of DDT, a persistent organic pollutant and its adverse environmental and health impacts, a study was undertaken by SDPI Research Team to examine the residual DDT in and around a DDT manufacturing factory in Amman Gharh, Nowshera, and NWFP.   The main crops of the area are Wheat, sugar cane, maize, sugar beet. Fruits like plum, pear, sweet orange, lemon, peach, apricot, guava etc are also grown frequently.   According to the 1998 census of Pakistan the population of the area was 874,373, a population density of 500.2 persons per km\u00b2. The annual growth rate was 2.9% and the proportion of urban dwellers was 26%.Muslims form 99% of the population, of the rest, Christian 0.5%; Ahmadi 0.3% and Hindu 0.1%.

The cholorinated solvents leached from the area or their waste was buried and ended up contaminating soil and the water aquifer outside the limits of the company. In 1999, the contamination was found in several residential wells and three wells in the Mall. People are exposed to the water and vapors from the ground. After almost 20 years the area remains to be remediated.  ______________________________________________________________________________  Previous information:  Gillette of Brazil (Procter & Gamble of Brazil Ltda.) Currently called Procter & Gamble of Brazil S/A, the old Gillette company is located to the Avenue Eusobio Stevaux, 2105. It is a residential area with great flow of people daily. The contamination was originated from the activities of the old one proprietor of the land, the Duracell company, who carried through, between 1984 and 1993 degreasers, it of covers of solvent batteries with chlorinated. In November of 2001, the company communicated spontaneously to the CETESB the confirmation of contamination of the ground and underground waters in its property.   The residues of the contamination are being removed of the place and destined for incineration in company TRIBEL in the Rio De Janeiro State, company that already possessed a contamination description and already it was condemned by the public prosecution service in 22 of October of 2009, having that to paralyze the act of receiving of residues of other states until a license for the IBAMA is forwarded, not to receive more products contend mercury and the payment of fine of U$ 1.178.897, 7306 that the ambient compensation will be destined (Papers - I.C.P n n\u00ba 1.30.017.000 070/2006-98). They are being sent residues I contend organoclorados and diverse metals including mercury which the company is forbidden to receive.

        "description": "Revda is in the Sverdlovsk oblast, in the mid-Urals on the Revda River, at the confluence of the Chusovaya River. Founded in 1734 when a metallurgical factory was built, it became a city in 1935. In 1940 the Sredneuralsk copper-smelting plant began operations here. The Sredneuralsky copper smelter is responsible for about 957,000 tons of pollutant emissions per year.   http://www.ecocom.ru/arhiv/ecocom/NEAP/eng/Chapter1.htm   Industries in Revda emit 400-450 tons of lead per year. The level of lead in soil exceeds the  permissible allowable concentrations by more than 10 times.   http://www.chem.unep.ch/pops/POPs_Inc/proceedings/stpetbrg/kurlyand.htm  Intas conducted a 3 year study (from 1994-1997) involving the ecological monitoring of forests in polluted areas in the Sverdlovsk region. The study area covered an area of approximately 25 x 30 km around the city of Revda. The results of the study revealed high metal concentrations near the smelter as compared to background concentrations: copper-up to 90-115-fold, lead up to 15-21-fold, zinc up to 10-19-fold and cadmium up to 10-16-fold. The soil contamination index K which is displayed by how many times the various pollutants measured exceeded the background level, reached as high as 128 at these sites.  http://www.intas.be/catalog/93-1645.HTM  The Chusovaya River is also extremely polluted by the effluents of the Sredneuralsky copper smelter. In 1996 the average annual concentration of copper compounds in the river\u2019s water was 116 MACs; hexavalent chromium, 33 MACs; manganese, 15 MACs; zinc 15 MACs; iron 5 MACs. Maximum concentrations were as high as 180, 65, 30, 15, and 8 MACs respectively.   http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:-_cQ-tmahQMJ:enrin.grida.no/caspian/additional_info/russia_98.pdf+diseases+in+revda&hl=en                                    air, water                        ",

        "health_impact": "Assessment of health risks: The risk to public health - namely, the phenomenon of stimulation of the upper respiratory tract and eyes, may be associated with the impact of single-maximum concentrations of sulfur dioxide. Long-term effects of concentrations of sulfur dioxide can cause (especially when combined with dust exposure) to the development of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, pneumosclerosis, as well as various clinical manifestations of the toxic lesion above the body's systems (including toxic hepatitis and gastritis).   Exposure to nitrogen dioxide is associated with excess of the maximum single-concentration of the pollutant MPC.  The risk of adverse effects to public health - namely, violations of biochemical mechanisms, above all, porphyrin metabolism, as well as toxic effects on all parts of the nervous system (especially in developing higher nervous activity in children), a variety of pathological changes in the cardiovascular system , kidney, liver and intestine, thyroid, immune system, female and male reproductive system - linked to the excess of the maximum single-MAC lead in ambient air.    \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd

Nanan Village, located in the west of Guiyu Town, has been specifically affected by chromium. Guiyu Town is an electronic trash city. Every day more than 100 freight vehicles, filled with loaded waste electric parts, comes into the small towns. The annual mean temperature is 21.4 degrees Celsius. The yearly average precipitation is 13,864 millimeters.       Nanan village is located at the west of Guiyu Town, where people resorted to all means to gain the recycled and used metal. In Nanan village shiny black ponds send out an odour, and the village is also fluttered with smoke continuously.      Here, air is suffocating, river water is polluted, and soil is poisoned. The serious contaminated ecological environment has also impaired villagers' health. Many labors were infected with respiratory disease, skin ulcers, even cancer.  They burn down the worn out electric wire and the electric cable with the sulfur acid water flushing circuit wafer. They burn down trash which are unable to be recycled again, and piled it up near the river. ",

Xianpeng Village has been especially affected by e-waste practices and the surface water in the region is contaminated with high levels of chromium. The area of Guiyu town of Shantou City in Guangdong Province is 52 square kilometers wide, with a total population of 139,000 people. The topography inclines from northwest to the southeast, and the majority of the land in the county has a very low elevation except for a small hill. It is in the South Asian tropics climate region.       Guiyu Town is an electronic trash city. Every day more than 100 freight vehicles loaded full of waste electronic parts visit the small towns. Xianpeng village is located south of Guiyu Town. People resorts to all means to gain recycled and used metals. The primary method involves nearly burning down the worn out electric wires and the electric cables, and with the sulfuric acid water flushing the circuit wafer. Burnt trash, unable to be recycled again, are piled up nearby the river . In Xianpeng village shiny black ponds containing the waste radiate odor. In a crude storehouse, a row of people often sit before the bunker and burn the circuit boards under a dim light.      Here, air is full of toxic pollutants, river water is polluted, and the soil is poisoned. Many people have skin diseases and ulcers, respiratory diseases, and even cancer.

        "description": "One of the most acute environmental problems of the West Urals region is a consequence of the cessation of mining in the area of the Kizel Coal Basin. High concentrations of iron, aluminum and trace metals in the region are due to the geochemical features of the Carboniferous strata. The coal of this basin differs from that of other basins in the former USSR, mainly because it contains large contents of sulfur (5.8%, mainly as pyrite) and ash (21.5%).  After the closure of the mine, acidic mine waters (with a pH of about 3) began to pollute the soil and rivers. Within the last five years, the tributaries of the Kama and Chusovaya Rivers have become highly polluted with dissolved metals such as iron and aluminum. In the more polluted sections of the rivers, accumulations of several tones of man-made bottom deposits have been found.  These accumulations include amorphous iron and aluminum hydroxides along with high concentration of Mn, Cu, Ni, Zn, Pb and others metals. These bottom deposits are washed downstream to the Kama and the Chusovaya Rivers, where they become a secondary source of water pollution.              People are affected primarily by drinking water contaminated with metals. Particulates in the air are also of concern.                       ",

        "health_impact": "Translation:  Mortality in Kizel is the highest in the Perm region.  In 2008, it amounted to 27.3% of the population, and the principal causes of death were diseases of the circulatory system. These diseases, in general, affect 47% of the population.  Diseases of the digestive system were found in  13% of the population. The next most common afflictions were \"neoplasms\" and \"respiratory diseases,\" at 10% and 8% respectively. The infant mortality rate trend over the past 10 years is that of a decline (growth rate - (-18%)), but remains significant. The mortality of children under 1 year old in 2008 was 15.7%. A significant increase in the incidence of \"neoplasms\" was observed, especially in children. The life expectancy in the Kizel population is the lowest in the province. In 2008, life expectancy at birth for the total population was 55.95 (females - 62.8,  males - 50.05). One survey found that the health status of children in the villages is characterized by multiorgan failure.  Through chemical analysis of toxins in the blood of residents in these mining towns, significant levels of heavy metals--such as copper, nickel, manganese, and lead--were found at levels significantly above the regional background concentrations.  This information was provided by experts at the Perm Scientific-Research Clinical Institute of Child ekopatologii.

        "description": "Update - 2016:  Shell Brasil Ltda was located at Av. Auriverde, 2028 - Vila Carioca \u2013 Ipiranga district - S\u00e3o Paulo.  Shell had two adjacent areas in Vila Carioca, one was used for storage of oil and of organochlorine solvents and the other, the Shell Sport Clube, was a social area for workers with soccer field and restaurant. This area had been where the company manufactured pesticides from 1972 to 1976.  The inadequate disposal of these substances caused the contamination of soil and water outsite the limits of the company.  Until 1985, most of the houses near Shell had wells. This water was used for cooking, for watering small plantations, and feeding pigs and chickens. There was no pavement on the streets. So, it is plausible to say that the population was exposed from water and soil contact.  ______________________________________________________________________________ Previous information:  Shell Brasil Ltda is located in a busy transit area with many houses in the capital of the country. This region has many rivers, abundant canals throughout the city, and groundwater reserves. Contamination poses a great potential risk here due to the types of pollutant and the fact that the contaminants have reached the air and the groundwater inside and outside the limits of the company. The ground and subsoil near the company have also been contaminated.   The company designed its activities to store organo-chlorides and the problem was caused by the burial of Shell's combustible waste tanks - the so called dregs - in the region, and from scraps from their own tanks.

It is in the South Asian tropics climate region; the annual mean temperature is 21.4 degrees C, and the yearly average precipitation is 13,864 millimeters.       Guiyu Town is an electronic trash city. Every day more than 100 freight vehicles loaded full of waste electronic parts visit the small towns. Xianma village is located south of Guiyu Town. People resorts to all means to gain recycled and used metals. The primary method involves nearly burning down the worn out electric wires and the electric cables, and with the sulfuric acid water flushing the circuit wafer. Burnt down trash, unable to be recycled again, are piled up nearby the river. In Xianma village shiny black ponds containing the waste were spewing odor.       In a crude storehouse, a row of people often sit before the bunker and burn the circuit boards under a dim light. The equipment that are used is crude: pliers, gloves, cups of tap water, and very rarely, face masks. The only safety equipment was a ventilator, but in the summer heat and the odors from toxic air can be suffocating.   Air from burning/water from waste",

It is surrounded by the Union Territory of Delhi in the north, by Uttar Pradesh in the east, by the Jhajjar and Rewai districts of Haryana and the Alwar district of Rajasthan State in the west, and by the Mewat district of Haryana in the south. Gurgaon is largely comprised of alluvial plains and traversed by elongated ridges of delhi quartzites.  The climate of the area is tropical steppe, semi-arid and hot, while in the monsoon season a moist air penetrates in the district which causes high humidity.  Annual rainfall= 596mm(2007 data) Normal monsoon rainfall= 508mm (2007 data)  The topography of Gurgaon district is flat, and the soil texture is medium loamy sand. No rivers are found in Gurgaon. The water supply is based on groundwater through tube wells.  The groundwater is mostly unsuitable for drinking due to natural alkaline and saline.  Upon visiting Sahraul village, our investigators found that the ground water contains Hexavelant Chromium and a high percentage of Nickel. Residents believe that the source of the pollution is M/S Munjal Showa, a factory engaged in electroplating processes and manufacturing of shock absorbers for two and three wheelers. The villagers complained that the industry discharges untreated effluent through boreholes. The contamination of water was discovered in 2007, but no action was taken.   Gurgaon is an industrial and BPO hub. It has been noted that the village is occupied by 20,000 permanent villagers and 100,000 immigrants. Almost 2,000-2,500 people are at risk due to drinking and bathing in the untreated water. The immigrants mainly are from the labor class and are fully dependent on the groundwater. As described by Mr. Mahavir Yadav, within a 500m periphery from the village the ground water is totally affected by the chromium.   The village has 8 tube wells, out of which 6 are affected and only 2 are in working condition.   Villagers said that Munjal Showa receives 250 water tankers each day and draws it out of the bore well.  Villagers purchase Rs.500 of water tankers a day and Rs.50 for besleri dispensers per day. However, the labor class immigrants still depend on the ground water.    Villagers are suffering from skin rashes and severe vomiting. According to Medical experts, consumption of water with high levels of chromium could lead to renal, kidney and liver failure and also liver, kidney and stomach cancer and skin diseases.  According to the villagers there are no industries nearby except BPOs and garments industries.

The community of La Rinconada is located in the Ananea district, Province of San Antonio de Putina in the department of Puno, in the highlands of Peru at more than 5,400 m, at 220 km from Puno City and 1317 km from Lima. This zone covers an area of approximately 200 km2.  This village is one of the highest in the world and is located in the Ananea snowcapped, mountain glacier, where temperatures reach to -25 oC. There are many rivers, rainfall, snowfall and hail. The Ananea snowcapped peaks have much gold contained in veins, and to access the mineral you must open tunnels using picks, drills or explosives.   This community lives with gold mining on a small and informal scale, and including the refining of gold is done at home. They do not have safe drinking water, drainage, or sanitary landfills. The people live in overcrowded houses, rustic.  They have a medical post and some educational institutions, but all are in the midst of mine tailings containing mercury and other toxic substances, household waste and excreta.  The mountains belong to the Peruvian state, which leases them to mining companies in the area who pollute the environment and affect to people permanently. In addition, many of the tailings generated by the extraction of minerals are used by women and children in the area looking for gold remains by using mercury in the open to obtain pure gold.  They Use 2g of mercury per gram gold. This causes tje release of mercury gases that affect the community. Lately, they are using machinery such as backhoes and electric turnstiles to increase gold production and consequently there is more pollution. Each year they produce approximately 3 tons of gold for 6 tons of mercury.  The activities also pollute the Cumuni lake and Riticucho glacial, which are used as water sources for the majority, but many households consume water from the melting of the ceiling due to their poverty. Besides, the streets of La Rinconada are flooded by fluids circulating tailings and streams to reach the nearest river, which flow into Titicaca lake, affecting crops and livestock and thousands of people living near the lake.                water, soil, air                    ",

According to data published in CENSO Demogr\u00e1fico, 2010, conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the municipality of S\u00e3o Francisco do Conde has an estimated population of 36 677 inhabitants and a territorial area of &#8203;&#8203;262,856 km\u00b2. The port of TEMADRE is responsible for the disposal of RLAM refinery products, such as diesel, gasoline, paraffin and lubricants. After the introduction of the Landulpho Alves-Mataripe Refinery (RLAM) in 1950, spills and oil spills in the Bay of All Saints region are common, contaminating soil, water and air with chromium. The environment of the industry is composed of a natural area of &#8203;&#8203;environmental preservation We found studies of metals from the Bay of All Saints, where the Landulpho Alves Refinery is installed. Most of the articles are related to water, suspended particulate matter, atmospheric particulate material, sediments and in studies of bivalve, fish, crustacean and mangrove species, and soil contaminant measurements are required. In the study CRA (2004) the sediments of the east and north of the bay, corresponding to the area adjacent to Mataripe and the Port of Aratu, were more contaminated in relation to hydrocarbons in suspended particulate matter and sediments.

A series of investigations by Ramani Rao and Dr B.C. Haldar for the Institute of Science in Mumbai revealed the presence of heavy metals in the aquatic environment of the Kalu River. The scientists examined a 10 km stretch of the Kalu between Ambivali and Titwala, surveying the water quality and effect of the industrial waste on plant and animal life.   They found heavy metals such as mercury, lead, copper, and cadmium in the river water, along with chlorides, dyes, and organic acids.

Mercury could lead to Kidney damage and neuropathy.  There have been epidemics of Hg poisoning from the consumption of fish from polluted Kalu River in the Thana district of Bombay, India. The major symptom amongst those afflicted was paralysis.  Likewise, mercury enters the food chain, poisoning the fish and the cattle that graze on plants in shallow water. The pycreus plants, the most abundant form of vegetation in Ambivali, showed high concentrations of heavy metals. The leaves of these plants contained 3 to 110 ppm of mercury. The rhizomes of the same plants contained 6.9 to 53.3 ppm.   The investigation also found 5 ppm of mercury in the milk of the cattle that graze on these plants. A child drinking a liter of this milk every day would be consuming 35 ppm mercury per a week.

The following examples are to be cited: effluent discharge, waste water and solid waste, hazardous and toxic waste; however, most of the old industries at Gikondo are to be relocated to  a new  planned area for industrial zone, and this was decided by the Government of Rwanda to reduce the environmental impact of these industries in the wetland.   Gikondo western part(Volta Super factory) The factory is located on the one slope of Gikondo valley, near the main road and Kicukiro-Gkondo-Kigali city center. This is the main factory for manufacturing a great quantity of Nickel cadmium batteries most used in the country.  The factory has been put in place in   a part of waste water used from manufacturing and washing, and cleaning inside of the factory is evacuated through the sewage channel situated near the secondary road going in Gikondo valley, where it is used by some people in washing clothes. Another part of waste water infiltrates into the groundwater, a leading natural source situated at the bottom of the hill, where many people unable to buy water all around the factory come to fetch water for cooking, washing dishes and their clothes. And the worst element is that much of this water from the springs and sewage channel ends up in Nyabugogo wetland channels and Nyabugogo River.  The environmental impact and human sanitation associated with that waste water are many.

Both are abandoned sites and are located about 1 k from each other at the National Highway 5, which connects Balasore & Baripada.  KCL was operational from 1983 to 1998, and during this time manufactured basic chrome sulfate (BCS) with an installed production capacity of 4800 TPA. During its operational period, it generated hazardous wastes that contained chromium. As per the National Productivity Council Report on Investigation and Remediation of Old Hazardous waste Dumps in Orissa, there are five identified dumps (two outside and three inside) within the industry premises, which covers an estimated area of 1200 square meters, which itself contains approximately 4200 tons of hazardous waste.   The area where the waste is dumped reportedly belongs to the owner. There is only a fenced wall at the front of the premises; the other three sides are left open, unprotected. Yellow-colored wastes and soils were seen scattered around many places around the abandoned structures and broken kiln, which indicates a high concentration of CrVI. The drainage paths were also found to be contaminated. It seems that during the rains, leachate is generated and the run-off overflows into the surrounding area, contaminating the nearby agricultural plots.  M/s Krebs & Cie Ltd  (Site KCL-I), Mayurbhanj , Orissa  The generated wastes were dumped on various sites existing inside and outside the unit. The site KCL-I is inside the premises of M/s KCL near H2SO4 tanks. The approximate total area under waste at all sites in 12000 sq.m and quantity of waste lying at sites is around 42000 MT.  For KCL-I: Area 4000 Sqm Average Depth 2.5 m 10000m3 (15000MT) *Bulk density of 1.5T/m3  It was engaged in manufacturing of chrome salt since 1983. The unit has been closed since 1998. The major product of the unit was basic chrome sulphate with installed production capacity of 4800 TPA. During operational period, the unit was generating hazardous waste containing chromium.     Likewise, during its operation until 2003, East Coast Fertilizers Ltd manufactured single super phosphate (SSP) and sulphuric acid. The unit was forced to close by the Board at the request of locals who were protesting against the contamination of their paddy fields.  During the investigation, two uncovered dumps were noticed, one outside the boundary and one near the cooling unit. A raw sulphur-dump was found inside the facility. An abundance of gypsum waste was noticed near the dismantled sheds. Spent vanadium (catalyst in the process) was found mixed into the waste at the second-dump. It is, however, not toxic as per Schedule 2 of Hazwaste Rules.  The locals are reportedly taking this muck from KCL to fill low-lying lands and thus are spreading the contamination to other places.  The ECFL Industry owner has sold the property. The new owner decided to open a school here, for which he did not need permission from the OPCB.  (Reported by Kadam group recently in 2013 that the two uncovered dumps were are still there; one outside the boundary and one near the cooling unit. A raw sulphur-dump was found inside the facility. An abundance of gypsum waste was noticed near the dismantled sheds. Spent vanadium (catalyst in the process) was found mixed into the waste at the second-dump.

Villages here are about 2-3 km from the sites and are reportedly using the pond waters for bathing purposes. However, the extent of groundwater contamination to affect food crops remains to be determined.          ",

        "description": "The Novocherkassk city has water streams as natural boundaries: Tuzlov River, Aksai River, and Grushevka River.  Aksai River is used as the source of centralized drinking water supply of the city. The northern part of the city (formerly Industrial District) is on the left slope of the Tuzlov River. Flood plain of the Tuzlov River does not have permanent buildings, but there are gardens and small temporary buildings. This is very densely populated area. 190,000 people live in the are of 50 square kilometers.   Novocherkassk is included in the 10 largest cities in the country with the highest concentration of industries per unit area. This creates environmental problems. Novocherkassk Electrode Plant is the largest plant for the production of graphite electrodes not only in Russia. This plant is one of the largest in Europe.  Coke and coal tar pitch are used as the main raw material in the plant. The plant usually uses carbon black, PTFE, talc, oleic acid, phenol, formalin, acids, alkalis. Carbon monoxide is the main component of emission. Hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and PAH get into the emissions too. More than 70 compounds (including benz(a)pyrene) were identified as a part of PAH. More than a thousand units of equipment is used at the plant. Not all equipment is equipped with gas- and dust collectors. (http://www.ecfor.ru/pdf.php?id=books/revich02/gor_t)  Benzo(a)pyrene is a priority pollutant for industrial district of Novocherkassk city. Its content in the groundwater ranges from 1 to 260 mg/l. Zones of emergency ecological situation were found near dumps and ponds of Novocherkassk Electrode Plant, on the area, also in residential areas Hotunok and Molodezhniy. Groundwater is contaminated with PAHs everywhere in Novocherkassk. Soils of Industrial District are highly polluted by PAHs with 4-7 nuclei. The max concentrations were on the area of Novocherkassk Electrode Plant and Plant \"Kollak\". The minimum concentrations were outside the industrial and residential areas (0.01-2.9 mg/kg). The tendency of reduces of PAH concentrations with increasing distance from the source (NEP) is obvious. PAH content in the soil of Pervomaysky District were significantly lower - 0,2-60 mg/kg. Concentration of benzo(a)pyrene were at the background levels (0,002-0,06 mg/kg). The high content of PAHs was found in the rivers. The highest concentrations were in drinking water source - Aksai river.

It is located 405 km southeast from the Russian city Omsk, and 440 km northeast of the capital, Astana.  Soils beneath and adjacent to the Pavlodar Chemical Plant in Kazakhstan have been contaminated with elemental mercury as a result of chlor-alkali processing using mercury cathode cell technology. The plant was closed in 1992, and its buildings have deteriorated since that time. Families now live around the industrial site.   Waters in the nearby Lake Balkyldak and the River Irtysh have high concentrations of mercury and fish from the waters are unfit for human consumption.   The issue of mercury contamination was recognized by the government and taken very seriously. In 1990s the government of Kazakhstan was seeking advice from national and international experts and looked for funds to implement the remediation project. The were several studies conducted by Kazakhstan and Russian specialists. The potential spreading of mercury contamination was modelled. A special \"filtration wall\" was constructed to prevent spreading of mercury further to the ground waters.  As indicated in most recent publication of Dr Panin on the area about half square kilometer there are about 900 metic tons of mercury. But in residential areas the concentrations of mercury are fairly low ranging from 0.08 to 18.96 ppm (Mercury in Snow and Soil of Pavlodar, Proceedings of the conference \"Mercury in Biosphere\", 7-9th of September 2010).   The remediation efforts in Pavlodar took place in 1997-2004. The last stage in 2000-2004 cost over 12 million USD. Since then the situation is monitored according to a special program.   The full description of mercury contamination in Pavlodar, remediation efforts, and monitoring program is in the attached 146 page file in Russian.        1) Water infiltration in ground water (30,000 people) 2) spreading in water Ishim river (20.000 people) 3) mercury dispersion in residential zone because of theft (3.000 people) (see information in details in additional notes)                             ",

Reasons: dangerous structure engineering  service; lack of advanced system downpour sewerage; leakage settling and plants storage; concreting natural drainage of ground water (embankment building).  2) spreading in water Ishim river Even in sampeles taken 250 km  downstream the river in Omsk district (Russia) there are considerable concentrations of mercury.  3) mercury dispersion in residential zone because of thefts. There was a collapse in USSR and industry management broke down. In that times  thefts were registered repeatedly. For example, in one Pavlodar country house it was found 114 kg of mercury in three containers. Cottage owner hid them after that he stole them from plant.  In 1999 Kazakhstan leaders addresses an appeal to France government with a request. They asked to finance thee ecological projects including a mercury liquidation project in Pavlodar. June 2000. Signing intergovernmental agreement between France and Kazakhstan government about providing Kazakhstan with a credit of 8,2 millions euro at a rate 2,1% on 16 years with favourable period of 6 years. France define assign company \"BRGM\" as a works contractor on Pavlodar chemical plant. Supposed two stages of solving the mercury problem. First - study of mercury spreading in soil and making a timetable of steps.Already at first stage French workers supposed to eliminate  about 1000 tones polluted soil. Than it was planned step-by-step destruction the whole hotbed of mercury pollution on termovacuum equipment.  That equipment doesn't pollute the environment. 1 Of November, 2001. On the parlament meeting prime minister of Kazakhstan K. Tokaev declared that government doesn't take any obligations on French credit. But study has been done and even free of charge. 2004. It was announced that clay wall around workshop is complete. This wall should isolate ground mercury pollution hearth.For completion this work and for mercury monitiring government has allocated 3,1 millions dollars. But specialists made there minds skeptically.  Thus, scientists of the Institute of  metallurgy and enrichment definitely reported: clay ring can't solve the problem, because the soil is dump and mercury spreading would continue - 1) evaporation from soil 2) round the ring - under the wall or over it in period of spring flood. Moreover danger increasing at the expense of percolation to artesian water. At the same time another technology using: partial utilization.

        "description": "The River Ravi is by far the most polluted river in Pakistan. The river gets most polluted while flowing through the regions between Lahore and Balloki. Much of the waste products are deposited in the river which contaminates its water. The river has been reduced to a channel due to the serious and heavy pollution discharges.  Ravi River flowing through both India and Pakistan originates at the Banghal basin. The river flows at a great speed through the region but is unfortunately the most polluted river in Pakistan. Ravi waters both India and Pakistan. Since its source is in India it flows through the northwestern part of Chamba and through the southwestern part of Jammu and Kashmir. Finally it reaches Pakistan to water the land of India's neighbor. The river drains a total catchment area of 14,442 square kilometers (5,576 sq mi) in India after flowing for a length of 725 kilometers (450 mi).  The Ravi valley in its upper reaches has Deodar, walnut, Quercus ilex, daphne, mulberry, alder, edible pine (Pinus gerardiana), twisted cypress (Cupressus torulosa), chinar (Platanus orientalis), daphne papyracea, cedrela serata, and sisso, olive and kakkar (raus).   According to official studies, the Ravi is the most polluted river in Pakistan. Most wastewater discharge reaches the river in a 60 km stretch between Balloki and Lahore. The Ravi is currently estimated to receive 47 percent of the total municipal and industrial discharge pumped into all rivers of Pakistan. In addition, industrial and agricultural waste from both India and Pakistan pour into the river through the Hudaira drain, which enters the Ravi on Lahore's outskirts.  As the River has died a slow and painful death, the fishing communities that for generations made a living from its waters have suffered too. The extreme pollution of the River Ravi has destroyed most of the 42 species of fish that once lived in the river, as well as the bird life around it, which has migrated to other areas. The survival of small invertebrates, micro fauna and flora is also threatened. (WWF Pakistan)  The weather of the area is extreme. Winters are very cold and summers are very hot with temperature soaring up to 40 C, but at the time of study it was pleasant. The direction of the wind  was southwards.  The Ravi has been transformed into the river of death which is playing havoc with the health of the citizens. As many as 42 species of fish have become extinct from the river. Dumping of sacrificial meat, industrial and hospital waste on the river-beds have made the situation worse. Various pathways are involved like:  drinking of contaminated water use of groundwater and surface water for drinking and irrigating children play at polluted place inhalation of polluted air",

        "description": "The state of San Luis Potosi is situated in the center of the country. It is bordered by Coahuila to the north, Nuevo Leon to the northeast, Tamaulipas to the east, Veracruz to the east, Hidalgo, Querutaro, and Guanajuato to the south, and Zacatecas to the northwest. At the 2005 census the population was 2,410,414.  San Luis Potos\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd is bounded on the east by Nuevo Le\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdn, Tamaulipas and Veracruz, on the south by Hidalgo, Quer\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdtaro and Guanajuato, and on the west by Zacatecas. The state lies mostly on the Mexican Plateau, with the exception of the southeastern corner of the state, where the tableland breaks down into the tropical valley of the Panuco River. The surface of the plateau is comparatively level, with some low mountainous wooded ridges.   The mean elevation is about 6,000 ft., ensuring a temperate climate. The state lies partly within the arid zone of the north, while the southern half receiving a more liberal rainfall through the influence of the Nortes, which deliver significant amounts of rain. The rainfall, however, is uncertain at the western and northern regions, and much of the state is poorly provided with rivers. The soil is fertile and in favorable seasons large crops of wheat, maize, beans and cotton are grown on the uplands. In the low tropical valleys, sugar, coffee, tobacco, peppers and fruit are staple products. Stockraising is an important industry and hides, tallow and wool are exported. Fine cabinet and construction woods are also exported to a limited extent.  At one time San Luis Potos\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd ranked among the leading mining provinces of Mexico, but the revolts following independence resulted in a great decline in that industry. Other common ores include  gold, copper, zinc and bismuth, as well as silver.  Morales is a community in the western part of the state capital, also named San Luis Potos\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd. It is primarily a smelter community, and the facility processes copper and lead.  Initial studies in 1993 showed that the median arsenic concentrations in the soil and dust were very high (502.4 and 857 \u00ce\u00bcg/g, respectively) in downtown Morales, which is located 1.5km from the smelter.   [D\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdaz-Barriga, F. et al. \"Arsenic and cadmium exposure in children living near a smelter complex in San \"Luis Potos\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd, Mexico. Environ Res 1993; 62:242-50.]    Ingestion of contaminated soil and dust was found to contribute to 88% of children's exposure in Morales.  The daily intake of arsenic for children dwelling on non-paved streets, in the least contaminated area, was estimated to be 1\u00ce\u00bcg/kg per day. In the most contaminated region, the estimated daily intake was 19.8\u00ce\u00bcg/kg/day. The reference dose established by the EPA is 1\u00ce\u00bcg/kg per day.        ",

The river originates in Chelyabinsk region, flows through Sverdlovsk region, and in Perm region joins Kama River of the Volga River Basin. The factory  \"Russian Chromium 1915\" is based in Pervouralsk of Sverdlovsk region. The latest biggest release of pollution was registered by local activists in May 2013. Untreated wastes were released in Pakhotka Creek that joins Chusovaya River. This is not the first and likely not last incident of pollution. In 2010 it was estimated that the factory released 1.3 million cubic meters of untreated or insufficiently treated waste water, containing 14 792 kg of chromium while total allowed volume was 583 kg for that year. The waste deposits of the factory also contain about 7 million tons of chromium containing wastes that may leak and contaminate environment.   In winter 2010-2011 the attorney of Sverdlovsk confirmed pollution of Chusovaya River by the factory. The waster water treatment facilities of the factory are old, outdated, and incapable of processing the whole volume of waste water. The concenrations of chromium in waste water exceeded the standard 20 times.   \"Russian Chromium 1915\" is the largest producer of chromium  in Russia. The factory operates for almost 100 years and a lot of equipment is very old. The waste storage oficially does not belong to the present owners of the factory and is not maintained properly. So nobody today is responsible for contamination coming from the waste storage site.  People fish on Chusovaya RIver close to the factory.

        "description": "Mining activities take place upstream from Gu Di village. There are 6 gold mines and 300 individual mills upstream.    The exploitation has lead to severe environmental problems.  There are large volumes of sediments in river, and the submerged farmlands and patties in Gu Di village of Bao Ping countryside have been polluted badly. The sediment mostly comes from tailings of ore concentrators from the mining.   About NanDan County/Province:  NanDan prefecture is a mountain area in HeChi city, the Northwest of GuangXi province. It produces more than 20 varieties of non-ferrous metals, such as tin, antimony, zinc, gold, silver, copper, iron, indium, tungsten and etc. It is one of the most important non-ferrous metal industrial bases in China. The total volume reaches to 11 million tons, including 1.44 million tons of tins.  DiaoJiang RIver belongs to Pearl River water system. It originates from the Southeast of NanDan prefecture, is 229 kilometers, with 3,585 square kilometers of watershed area. It passes through more than 10 townships of Nan Dan prefecture, He Chi city and Du An prefecture. The non-ferrous minerals are mainly concentrated in DaChang town and CheHe town in NanDan, which is the origin of DiaoJiang River. There are about nine owned mining companies. 65 ore dressing plants (with the daily treatment capacity of over 30 tons each) along NanDan stretch. The private ore dressing companies numbered 324 units at their peak. There are around 3000 private mining points. The total annual ore processing capacity is nearly 2.5 million tons.  NanDan stretch, originating out of DiaoJiang River, is a maze of mines and tailings. The legacy tailings are piled at will. The primitive facilities of ore dressing companies, especially that of these private companies, handle the waste rock, disposed slag, wastewater and tailings under poor management conditions, which increase the potential pollution possibilities.   In addition, due to the mining activities, large areas of the land surface are exposed. The original soil is covered by tailings or abandoned stones, which contain multiple varieties of heavy metals. In the rainy season, precipitation  creates heavy soil erosion, and some tailings or some heavy metals are leached into the DiaoJiang River, making the river red and turbid.   The waste waters from the mill and tailings have not been disposed of, and still contaminate the DiaoJiang River and farmland soils. ",

        "description": "Bangalore also known as Bengaluru, is the capital of the state of Karnataka. Located on the Deccan Plateau in the south-eastern part of Karnataka, Bangalore is India's third most populous city and fifth-most populous urban agglomeration.   As of 2009, Bangalore was inducted in the list of Global cities and ranked as a \"Beta World City\" alongside Geneva, Copenhagen, Boston, Cairo, Riyadh, Berlin, to name a few, in the studies performed by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network in 2008.  Today as a large city and growing metropolis, Bangalore is home to many of the most well-recognized colleges and research institutions in India.  Numerous public sector heavy industries, software companies, aerospace, telecommunications, and defence organisations are located in the city.   Bangalore is known as the Silicon Valley of India because of its position as the nation's leading IT exporter.  A demographically diverse city, Bangalore is a major economic and cultural hub and the fastest growing major metropolis in India.  The headquarter of several public sector undertakings such as Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL), Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML) and Hindustan Machine Tools (HMT) are located in Bangalore.   In June 1972 the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) was established under the Department of Space and headquartered in the city.  The site Madiwala lake is one of the biggest lakes in Bangalore, India spread over an area of 114.3 hectare. It is situated in the BTM Layout in Bangalore city.   It is a home to many migratory birds. The Madiwala Lake comes under the administration of Karnataka State Forest Department.  As the city's growth spiraled, the Madivala Lake was subjected to intense pollution, with the blockage of inflow channels, immersion of religious idols,encroachments into the catchment area and inflow of sewage water.   With chemical waste being dumped into the lake by neighboring industrial units every day, the water has turned acidic.(links attached)  All these had transformed the lake into a very large sewage pool. Madivala Lake, which was once, a fresh water tank, was fully covered with thick growth water hyacinth, thus preventing aeration and affecting the bio-diversity of flora and fauna.              Water  and soil are  the likely transmission pathway as the heavy metal pollution has been found in lake water and soil samples.   Water from lake is used for washing purposes,hence regular contact with human population is there.  Fish present in the lake also reports of traces of heavy metals.  The fish from lake is sold in Madiwala market;with heavy metals presence in fish samples,the same is entering the food chain,thus seriously impacting human health.  Historically lakes in the Bangalore region were managed by a plethora of government agencies such as the Forest Department, Minor Irrigation Department, Horticulture Department, Public Works Department (PWD), Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BMP), Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), Tourism Department, City Municipal Councils and Panchayats; each organization claiming its own jurisdiction of ownership and maintenance rights resulting in a deficient, inconsistent and uncoordinated approach   The Government of Karnataka, following the directive of The Honourable High Court of Karnataka and considering the unchecked deterioration of lakes in and around Bangalore and keeping in line with their critical role in maintaining healthy environs and recharging of ground water, set up the Lake Development Authority (LDA) in July 2002 as a registered society under the Karnataka Societies Registration Act, 1959, as a non-profit organization and a para\u2013statal body with a mandate of  \"working solely for the regeneration and conservation of lakes in and around Bangalore city within BMRDA jurisdiction in the first instance, would be extended to other parts of Karnataka subsequently\"                  ",

        "description": "The Dilovasi Industrial Organized District (DOSB), a region within the Gebze district of the Kocaeli Province, is highly industrialized with few emissions restrictions in place.  Its development followed Turkey's rapid urbanization and industrialization in the 1980s.  Dilovasi is 63 miles east of Istanbul and is reported to house more than 170 under-regulated plants and factories.  Many of these are located in the middle of residential neighborhoods like the Yeni Yidiz and Fatih neighborhoods.  Industry activities include steel production, chemical manufacturing, metals processing, and factories producing paints and varnishes.  2005 figures reported by the Turkish Daily News stated that 44 percent of all factories were unlicensed, 76 percent did not have waste-disposal permits, and nearly 72 percent lacked emissions licenses.  In late 2006, a parliamentary committee issued a report demonstrating that many factories were using carcinogenic products without establishing adequate protective measures.  The discharge from these factories is dumped into the Dildresi River, which is further responsible for over 40% of the pollution flowing into the Gulf of Izmit and 20% of that flowing into the Sea of Marmara, according to an official at a local environmental protection association.  Pollution is also directly dumped into Eynerce Creek and Dil Creek.    A May 2006 study by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey demonstrated that the proportion of cadmium in the air is over 239 times the European Union advised limit and over 30 times the Turkish.  It has been determined that those living in Dilovasi inhale a dangerously high level of toxic fumes on a regular basis.  A 24-hour sample taken between April 17 and 18, 2006 and a 48-hour sample taken between April 18-20, 2006 showed markedly high levels of cadmium in the air.  Levels were reported to be 1.195micrograms/cubic metre.  EU standards allow for 0.005 mikrograms/cubic metre and Turkish samples allow for 0.04.   A 2006 parliamentary commission report called for evacuation of the Yeni Yildiz and Fatih neighborhoods.  It stated that most of the waste produced by factories in the region was hazardous to health and that industries were not taking enough preventative measures in disposal.    <p>Coordinates: 40.7916487903, 29.5306325866       Air  Although the test data deals with cadmium in the air, water is also being polluted.

These reports state that 32.3 percent of all deaths in the region are due to cancer, 44 percent of which involve lung cancer. The commission's report recommended the initiation of a comprehensive cancer assessment in the region.  Other reports have concluded that the death rates from cancer in Dilovasi are 2.7 times the world average and 2.6 times the Turkish.  Deaths caused by lung and stomach cancer are 2.6 times the world average; deaths from prostate cancer are noted to be 3.2 times higher.  A report by a physician at the University of Koaceli nearby quotes that \"While the world average for mortality due to cancer is 12%, the rate is 30% in Dilovasi.\"  These same reports state that residents who have lived in the region 10 years are 4.4 times more likely to die from cancer than those who have not.

The industry is principally located in the beach area of Fauzdarhat and is spread along a 16km stretch of the coastline encompassing Selimpur, Bhatiary, Sonaichhari and Kumira Unions (latitude 22 25\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2 and 22 28\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2N, and longitude 91 42\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2 and 91 45\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2E ) of Sitakunda Upazilla (22 22\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2 and 22 42\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2 N latitude and 91 34\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2 and 91 48\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2 E longitude) of Chittagong district (22 37\u00e2\u20ac\u00b200\u00e2\u20ac\u00b3N 91 9\u00e2\u20ac\u00b240\u00e2\u20ac\u00b3E 22 61\u00e2\u20ac\u00b267\u00e2\u20ac\u00b3N 91 66\u00e2\u20ac\u00b211\u00e2\u20ac\u00b3E).   Sitakunda Upazila occupies an area of 483.97 square kilometres, which includes 61.61 square kilometres of forest. It is bordered by Mirsharai to the north, Pahartali to the south, Fatickchhari, Hathazari and Panchlaish to the east, and the Sandwip Channel in the Bay of Bengal to the west.   The Sitakunda range is 70 kilometres long and 10 kilometres wide and is one of the westernmost ranges of Chittagong and Chittagong Hill Tracts, delimited by the Feni River in the north, the Karnaphuli River in the south, the Halda River in the east and the Sandwip Channel in the west. The Sitakunda range acts as a water divide between the Halda Valley and the Sandwip Channel. The Sandwip Channel represents the northern end of the western part of the Chittagong-Tripura Folded Belt.   The Sitakunda range is a 32-kilometre long ridge in the center of the Upazila, which reaches an altitude of 352 meters above sea level at Chandranath or Sitakunda peak, the highest peak in Chittagong District. Part of Sitakunda is covered by low hill ranges, while the rest is in the Bengal flood plain. To the north, Rajbari Tila at 274 metres and Sajidhala at 244 metres are the highest peaks in this range, which drops abruptly to a height of less than 92 metres in the vicinity of Chittagong City to the south.   Sitakunda Town, with an area of 28.63 square kilometres is the administrative center and the sole municipality (Pourashabha) of Sitakunda Upazila. The rest of the area is rural and organized into 10 Union Committees (Union Parishads), namely Banshbaria, Barabkunda, Bariadyala, Bhatiari, Kumira, Muradpur, Salimpur, Sonaichhari, Saidpur and Bhatiari Cantonment Area.   The area is divided into 69 mauzas and 59 villages. According to the census of 2001, Sitakunda had a population of 335,178 with a gender ratio of 119:100. As of 2001, the population density of Sitakunda was 693 inhabitants per square km. The average populations of administrative units are: 33,518 for unions, 4,858 for mauzas (revenue villages), and 5,681 for villages, reported by the census.   Annual average temperature is between 32.5 C and 13.5 C with an annual rainfall of 2,687 millimeters. The main occupations of the local people by industry are service (28.76%), commerce (21.53%), and agriculture (24.12%). Out of 12,140.83 hectares of cultivatable  land, 25.46% yield a single crop, 57.95% yield double and 16.59% a triple crop annually. Fishing has traditionally been an industry restricted to low caste Hindus belonging to the fisher class, although for the last decades of the 20th century an increasing number of Muslims have joined the sector. According to a 2001 survey, 4,000 people in Sitakunda were engaged in wild shrimp fry collection.   Ship-breaking was initiated in this area in 1969. The area where the ship scrapping industry is located in Chittagong used to be covered by a mangrove forest which has progressively declined with the increase in the number of ship scrapping yards over the years. In 1983 there were 32 companies involved in the scrapping industry in Chittagong. The number of companies involved had once increased to 150 (in >60 yards) and at present around 70 companies are involved in ship scrapping activities in 24 yards. Currently, this activity takes place along the coastline of Selimpur, Bhatiary, Sonaichhari and Kumira unions.  The total population of  Selimpur (35,142), Bhatiary (49,490), Sonaichhari (38,458) and Kumira (34,135) unions is 157,245. Around 25,000 workers are directly involved in ship scrapping activities and another 200,000 individuals are engaged in businesses related to the ship scrapping activities in Bangladesh.  From 2005 to 2007, more than 250 ships, with a total weight in excess of 2.5 million tons, were broken on the shores of Bangladesh. Depending on their size and function, scrapped ships have an unladen weight of between 5,000 and 40,000 tones (an average of 13000+), 95% of which is steel, coated with between 10 and 100 tones of paint containing lead, cadmium, organotins, arsenic, zinc and chromium. Ships also contain a wide range of other hazardous wastes: sealants containing PCBs; up to 7.5 tones of various types of asbestos; several thousands liters of oil (engine oil, bilge oil, hydraulic and lubricant oils and grease). Tankers additionally hold up to 1,000 cubic meters of residual oil. Most of these materials are defined as hazardous waste under the Basel Convention.

        "health_impact": "Exposure to POPs may cause acute, medium, or long-term impacts. POPs are chemicals that are highly toxic, remain intact in the environment for long periods, become widely distributed geographically, bioaccumulate through the food chain, accumulate in the fatty tissue of living organisms, and pose a risk of causing adverse effects to human populations, wildlife, and the environment.   There has been a realization that these pollutants, upon exposure of human populations, can cause serious health effects ranging from increased incidence of cancers to disruption of hormonal systems. These effects have also been observed and recorded for various animal species.   Acute poisoning, usually due to exposure to large quantities in a very short time, may lead to an increase in sensitivity and a tingling sensation in the face and limbs, giddiness, lack of coordination, tremors, and mental confusion.   If ingested, gastrointestinal irritation (vomiting and diarrhea) occur. In the case of severe intoxication: muscular contractions followed by generalized convulsions, cardiac arrhythmia due to increased cardiac irritability, and even coma and respiratory depression may occur.  Medium-and long-term effects may be observed after a single exposure to a large non-lethal dose or after repeated exposures to doses that are usually low. And they include reproductive effects (abortion, retardation of fetal growth, birth defects and increased mortality among the newborns of exposed mothers), and infertility and loss of libido (exposure to aldrin and dieldrin).   Almost all POPs are mutagenic (except mirex and toxaphene) and are considered as potential carcinogens. Chlordane, DDT, heptachlor, aldrin and dieldrin are associated with liver cancer. DDT is also associated with breast cancer and dieldrin with cancer of the adrenal glands.  Medium or long term exposure to POPs may induce loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea, headaches, sleep alterations, peripheral neuropathy, liver and renal damage, cardiac arrhythmia, eye problems (allergic conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and retinal angiopathy). Personality changes and difficulties in concentrating may occur particularly in people exposed to heptachlor.  PCBs are highly toxic and persistent pollutants. They bioaccumulate and get highly magnified in the fatty tissue, especially in higher trophic levels of the food chain. Exposure to PCBs has been associated with a variety of adverse health problems. PCBs have been linked to cancer, liver damage, reproductive impairments, immune system damage and behavioral and neurological damage.  Dioxins are carcinogenic and can suppress the immune system. Dioxins are suspected to have prenatal and post natal effects on children's nervous systems. They have been linked to endocrine disruption, reproductive abnormalities, neurological problems, and infertility in both humans and animals. Moreover dioxin exposures are associated with increased risk of severe skin lesions such as chloracne and hyper-pigmentation, altered liver function and lipid metabolism, general weakness associated with drastic weight loss, changes in activities of various liver enzymes, and depression of the immune system.  Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can have a negative impact on the environment and human health. PVC has been known to cause Raynaud's syndrome, scleroderma, cholangiocarcinoma, asthma angiosarcoma, liver cancer, brain cancer, acroosteolysis and risks of impaired human reproduction, etc.  PAHs have been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals, and also in humans following occupational exposure at high concentrations. Some 30 compounds and several hundreds of derivatives are carcinogenic. A number of PAHs have been shown to be genotoxic (i.e. they interact with the genetic material in cells). The EU Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) identified 15 PAHs that may be genotoxic and carcinogenic to humans (SCF, 2002). PAHs cause malignant tumors by interfering with enzymatic breakdown, affecting the lungs, stomach, intestine and skin.  Organotins: TBT is considered as one of the most toxic compounds in the aquatic ecosystems. Its impact on marine organisms ranges from the subtle to the lethal. TBT is responsible for the disruption of the endocrine system of marine shellfish leading to the development of male characteristics in female marine snails.   TBT also impairs the immune system of organisms. Shellfish are reported to have developed shell malformation after exposure to extremely low levels of TBT in the seawater.   Organotins are nerve toxins that accumulate in the blood, liver, kidneys and brain. High doses of organotins have been shown to damage the central nervous system and reproductive mechanisms in mammals. The most widely used organotin, tributyltin(TBT), is an endocrine disrupting chemical in mammals. There is evidence of organotins having an endocrine disrupting effect in fish. Some recent works appear to suggest that the consumption of contaminated fish is posing a real threat to humans. Organotins also bioaccumulate in certain marine species, some of which are food species used by humans. Organotins have endocrine disrupting ability in humans. Butyltins disrupt the critical function of human immune cells, particularly killer cells. As organotin compounds particularly TBT can damage human health even in small doses.   Asbestos inhalation leads to a slow buildup of scar-like tissue in the lungs and in the membrane that surrounds the lungs. This scar-like tissue does not expand and contract like normal lung tissue and so breathing becomes difficult and this hampers the ability to exchange gases. Blood flow to the lungs may also be decreased, and this causes the heart to enlarge, thus leading to a disease called asbestosis. People with asbestosis have shortness of breath, often accompanied by a cough. This disease can eventually lead to disability or death. Exposure to asbestos may lead to cancer of the lung tissue itself and mesothelioma (cancer of the membrane that surrounds the lung and also of other internal organs). Inhalation of asbestos can increase the chances of getting cancer in other locations (for example, the stomach, intestines, esophagus, pancreas, and kidneys). Members of the public who are exposed to lower levels of asbestos may also have increased chances of getting cancer, but the risks are usually small and are difficult to measure directly.   Mercury is a toxic heavy metal that affects the nervous system. Mercury poisoning has been linked to outbreaks called \"Minamata disease\". This is a disorder of the central nervous system caused by the consumption of fish and shellfish contaminated with methyl mercury. Clinical manifestation differs from inorganic mercury poisoning in which the kidneys and the renal system are damaged. Young children are most vulnerable. Long term exposure to low levels can cause irreversible learning difficulties. Mercury can also cause mental retardation and delayed neurological and physical development.  Lead (Pb) is a toxic heavy metal that accumulates in blood and bones after inhalation or ingestion. Most of the lead that enters the human body accumulates in the bones. Long term exposure to lead may cause brain and kidney damage, and increased blood pressure. Young children are most vulnerable to its toxic effects. Adverse health effects of lead exposure include impaired mental and physical development, decreased heme-biosynthesis, elevated hearing threshold, and decreased IQ and serum levels of vitamin-D. Long-term exposure to even low levels can cause irreversible learning difficulties, mental retardation and delayed neurological and physical development, even death.  Arsenic is a human carcinogen.  Acute exposure to inorganic arsenic has serious adverse health effects. Exposure can result in lung cancer, cancer of the skin, intestine, kidney, liver or bladder. Arsenic has a wide range of effects: it can cause damage to blood vessels and nervous tissue; has adverse reproductive effects; and is also considered as an endocrine disruptor.  Though in small amounts (0.0007 to 0.003 mg/kg/day) Chromium is considered an essential nutrient for humans that helps normal metabolism (cholesterol, glucose, and fat), in large amounts it can be harmful. The hexavalent form of chromium is irritating and can cause acute adverse effects on the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney. Some chrome based chemicals can cause eczema. When exposed to dust and fumes people may develop respiratory diseases such as lung cancer.  Oil is a highly volatile compound composed of mainly hydrocarbon, sulfur containing compounds, etc. Approximately 75% of the constituents of oil are hydrocarbons. Oil may cause serious damage to Seabirds, marine mammals, fish, molluscs, crustaceans and turtles, marine plants and human health.   Sea birds or diving birds that spend much of their time on or near the shore become oiled when feeding in contaminated areas. Consequently, many die due to drowning or poisoning. Other effects on the feathered creature can include: damage to the liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, and other internal organs; pneumonia; reduction in the ability to reproduce; decline in the number of eggs laid; decreased fertility of eggs and thinner shell thickness; and disruption of normal breeding and incubating behaviors.   Marine mammals may suffer from poisoning and toxic effects due to ingestion of oil; congested lungs and damaged airways; gastrointestinal ulceration and hemorrhaging.  When oil seeps into shallow or confined waters, fish can be seriously affected. Fish eggs, larvae, and juveniles are much more sensitive to damage. Eggs may not hatch or may be totally destroyed. Fish absorb oil that is dissolved in water through their gills, accumulating it within the liver, stomach, and gall bladder. Such fish may be unfit for human consumption. Many molluscs, shrimp, and worms have a natural ability to purify themselves of contaminants, if the concentration is low or if the source has been removed.  Marine plants like kelp, marsh grass, mangroves, and sea grasses are some of the types of marine vegetation that are hurt by oil spills. Plants occupying the area between high and low tide marks are also adversley impacted. Human health may be affected by oil spills. Especially when contamination of drinking water sources take place. Food sources, such as fish and crustaceans, both marine and fresh water, may be tainted and the consumption of tainted food may cause human health problems. Oil pollution may threaten the livelihood of fishermen.  Reports on human health effects of pollutants from ship breaking industry in Bangladesh are scarce. Hossain, et al (2008) reported health effects among workers involved in ship scrapping that could be contributed to exposure of pollutants released as a consequence of ship scrapping activities. They reported that besides being affected by burns, injuries, explosions, and gas poisoning, most of the workers suffer from multiple diseases and health hazards. The workers face the problem of eye redness, tearing, burning sensation, blurring of vision and conjunctivitis, and respiratory problems. Respiratory problems among the workers include asthma, pneumonia, chest pain, cough and sputum. Abdominal, urinary, muscle and skin problems as well as nutritional deficiency are also identified among the workers, which are mainly caused due to toxic metal, oil and chemical contaminations as well as excessive work loads, long working hours, insufficient diets, unsafe drinking water, etc.  Major health hazards and diseases of ship scraping workers at Chittagong coast (Hossain et al 2008)  Heath hazards\tNumber of workers [n=216]\tPercentage (%)\tCauses Eye problems\t201\t93.06\tBright light, fire, dust, oxyacetylene, welding fume.

It is situated in north-western India in the Malwa (Punjab) Region. Courtesy to five artificial lakes in the city, Bathinda is also known as \"The city of Lakes\".Bathinda is located on the Indo-Gangetic alluvial plains. Bathinda's climate correspond to semi arid with high variation between summer and winter temperatures. Average annual rainfall is in a range of 20 - 40cm Bathinda is surrounded by 12 small and medium towns, making the city a hub of most industrial activities in the region.  Bathinda is one of the largest railway junctions of India. More lines extend from it than any other junction on the Indian Railway network. Bathinda cantonment is also said to be the largest in India. Bathinda has one of the biggest food-grain and cotton markets in India. The Multinational Corporation Pepsi processes horticultural products grown in Bathinda.  Major industries in Bathinda include, National Fertilizers Plant, two power plants: Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant and Guru Hargobind Thermal Plant(Lehra Mohabbat), Petrochemical Plants, Yarn & Textiles Plants, Citrus Fruit Belts and Sugar Mills. HMEL is building a Grassroots oil refinery in Bathinda.  Giana, Malkana Jajjal are the villages which exist in Bathinda, Punjab and due to industrial activity and excessive use of pesticide make them more prone to cancer and mental retardation. It is difficult to predict where the Uranium found in the area is coming from, but the most possible source is Thermal Power Plant . These plants are very near to these  villages and it may be possible source of uranium contamination.  The Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant ( \u00e0\u00a8\u2014\u00e0\u00a9\u0081\u00e0\u00a8\u00b0\u00e0\u00a9\u201a \u00e0\u00a8\u00a8\u00e0\u00a8\u00be\u00e0\u00a8\u00a8\u00e0\u00a8\u2022 \u00e0\u00a8\u00a6\u00e0\u00a9\u2021\u00e0\u00a8\u00b5 \u00e0\u00a8\u00a5\u00e0\u00a8\u00b0\u00e0\u00a8\u00ae\u00e0\u00a8\u00b2 \u00e0\u00a8\u00aa\u00e0\u00a8\u00b2\u00e0\u00a8\u00be\u00e0\u00a8\u201a\u00e0\u00a8\u0178 ) at Bathinda[ is one of the three thermal power stations in Punjab (the other being at Lehra Mohabat and Ropar). It is a medium sized power station with 4 units that were started in the early 1970s and completeted in 1982. All total generate upto 440 Mw of power that meets the mammoth irrigation needs of lower Punjab.  At couple of years back the Thermal Plant's functioning, which some claim is not upto contemporary environment safety standards, has caused serious health problems, not only in Bathinda itself, but also in nearby towns and villages.  Fly ash is a particular problem.                                 Air, water, soil.  In this study, 27/113 children, who showed high uranium levels in their hair samples, live in the city of Bathinda, where the Guru Nanak Dev and Lehra Mohabbat Thermal Power Plants are.  These thermal plants produce high quantities of fly-ash from the burning of coal.  31% (almost a third) of the children tested (who are afflicted with the most severe neurological and cognitive conditions) come directly from a radius of less than 15 kms of this power plant.  More than 70% of India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electricity generation is produced by coal-based thermal power plants.  The environmental impact of the coal industry and thermal power plants in Punjab can and should not be minimized or under-estimated.                   ",

The village suffers from serious arsenic pollution as a result of extraction of arsenic at the quarry in Uravi and Racha Mining Industrial Complex, currently non-operational, is responsible for present arsenic contamination.   Gas exhaust from the plant was the strongest  source of anthropogenic arsenic emission and this toxin was deposited via precipitation into R. Lukhuni which in turn flows into the Black Sea. In addition, pollution also resulted from acidic waters and ore deposits flowing out of mines. This pollution affects ecology, biodiversity and marine resources of the area.  Arsenic production was actively used in the soviet period for military and civilian purposes and around 100,000 tons of waste from the mining industry were left on-site, which presently creates a serious hazard for human health.   There is a large arsenic dump (cement storage sarcophagus) above the town, but it is not completely closed and the rain water filters in and then back out into local surface waters and agricultural lands.  The cement walls of the sarcophagus sit directly next to the river and are at risk of falling into the river and spilling the entire contents of the dump into the surface waters.   Recent tests show arsenic levels in the soil around the village are 20-30 times higher than normal. Other scientific studies, from Tbilisi State Medical University, have found arsenic in the blood of local children.  There are some reports that the Env. Ministry has outlined a project for neutralization and utilization of this waste. The Minister says the government is aware of the problem, but with its economy still only 60% of what it was in Soviet times, the country just does not have the necessary resources.

Kanpur is situated between the River Ganga in the north and the River Pandu in the south. The total area of Kanpur Nagar district is 1040 sq km.  The River Ganga and River Pandu are the recipients of over 300 mld of the total wastewater generated in Kanpur.  Jajmau is a suburb of Kanpur. It is located downstream of the Ganga and has been receiving a large portion of the city's wastewater. It has been using treated sewage and tannery effluents for irrigation purposes since the early fifties, when raw sewage was being diluted with Ganga water and then supplied for irrigation.   Jajmau is believed to be the oldest inhabited place in the region and the main industry is the leather industry. It is home to some of the biggest leather tanneries in Northern India. Currently, there are 407 tannery units in Jajmau and the entire area consists of 20 villages and a population of roughly 30,000. The tannery waste is being transported to Rooma-TSDF.  In Jajmau, the lack of treatment facilities has led to tannery sludge being dumped on temporary sites exposed to human traffic. There are around 25 villages downstream from a cluster of 354 leather tanneries that have been severely impacted by untreated effluents from these units. Use of the polluted water for irrigation purposes and indiscriminate dumping of toxic tannery sludge has led to the poisoning of local population.

He also mentioned that there is no Tanneries and other units that could create the problems but the problems persist in Walajapet because of Ranipent based Chemical and tanneries and leather industries and CETP which are not functioning properly.  As there is sever water crisis in Walajapet and entire Vellore and the supply water is also salty so the community of nearby villages do mix the salty water with good water to meet their daily requirement.

        "description": "Rajsamand is situated at the southern tip of Rajasthan. The region is oval in shape, with a very narrow strip stretching towards the North. The district adjoins the Udaipur, Pali, Bhilwara, Ajmer, and Chittor districts. Rajsamand is located 65 km from Udaipur and was constituted on the 10th of April, 1990.  The district was named after the famous lake \"Rajsamand,\" built by Maharana Raj Singh. The place is very well known for its marble production; it is the largest marble producing district in India.  Deogarh, or Devgarh, is an important small town that lies in Rajsamand district. It is 150 km from Ajmer, off the National Highway No 8, which runs from Delhi through Rajsamand and Udaipur.   Amphibole asbestos deposits occur sporadically  in the Deogarh region, specifically in an area extending from east of Charbhuja to northeast of Deogarh for a strike length of about 50 km. The deposits are mainly located from south-west to north-east near the villages Lalji-ka-khera, Roopji-ka-khera, Kalaguman, Tekhi, Kunwathal etc. The activities of these asbestos mills have been contaminating the air in the region.          Air is the likely transmission pathway, as asbestos fiber count has been found to be above the permissible limits.           ",

These indigenous asbestos produced enhanced MN and SCE registering their genotoxic nature. Different genotoxic activity of these samples could be attributed to the asbestos content and different mechanism(s) responsible for these events. Peripheral blood samples were also collected from the asbestos exposed population to assess genotoxicity through micronuclei (MN) formation.  Micronuclei levels were significantly higher in exposed populations compared to unexposed populations.  The data reveal that the exposed population is vulnerable for lung cancer, as MN is a biomarker for cancer.   The higher number of induced MN observed is in cases of exposed smokers, which clearly indicates the synergistic interaction between cigarette smoke and asbestos exposure.            ",
        "notes": "Mean asbestos fiber counts in these unorganized asbestos mills were 4.07-15.6 f/cc at Deogarh. Invariably, the fiber concentrations monitored by area samplers were always higher than that of personal samplers.  Briefly, asbestos fiber concentrations in the work environment of all the asbestos mills at Deogarh exceeded the permissible standard of 1 f/cc.  It is beyond doubt that workers in asbestos mills in Rajasthan are at serious risk of asbestos exposure.         ",

It is the largest producer of cement in northern India and home to Shree cement. It is also mineral rich and has reserves of felspar, quartz, asbestos, soapstone, magnesitie, calcite, limestone, mica, emerald, granite, and masonry stone.  Fairly good reserves of barytes fluorit, wolastonite and vermiculite have also been found.

Mean asbestos fiber counts in these unorganized asbestos mills were 2.0-5.09 f/cc at Beawer. Invariably, the fiber concentrations monitored by area sampler were always higher than that of personal sampler.   Briefly, asbestos fibre concentration in the work environment of all the asbestos mills, both at  Beawer, exceeded the permissible standard of 1 f/cc. It is beyond doubt that workers in asbestos mills in Rajasthan are at serious risk of asbestos exposure.   Studies both with light microscopic and electron microscopic showed these asbestos fibers are amphiboles. It is an established fact that amphiboles are much more toxic, asbestotic and carcinogenic than serpentine.  Cigarette smoking and asbestos exposure have additive or synergistic interactions in inducing cancer of the lung . The combination of tobacco smoking and asbestos exposure leads to an enormously high incidence of bronchogenic carcinoma.  About 35 % workers were smokers in asbestos-based industries belonging to organized and unorganized sectors.         ",

The company Qu\u00edmica Central de M\u00e9xico produced 30 thousand tons per year of basic chromium sulfate, 14 thousand tons of sodium bichromate and 1,500 tons of chromic acid, and 6 thousand tons of oils used by many industries. During its 42 years of operation, the company did not adequately manage toxic waste. After its closure, it left a pile  almost 300 meters long in the open. The pile contains 196,000 tons of chromium waste, 11,000 cubic meters of chromium-containing alumina, and 3,000 cubic meters of chromium-containing debris.

For their part, the inhabitants of the rural community of Buenavista (within the municipality of Pur\u00edsima del Rinc\u00f3n), located less than 500 meters from the abandoned plant, report suffering from respiratory and skin allergies and claim that people have died in the area due to cancer.

        "notes": "The neighbors report that before the arrival of Qu\u00edmica Central de M\u00e9xico, the localities used to have very clean water that came from the subsoil. Since the plant was installed, they avoid drinking ground water and do not irrigate their crops with this water either.  To irrigate their crops they use water from the Barrial Dam.  The municipality provides them with a free water pipe for their domestic needs, as it is known that the groundwater is contaminated with chromium 6 and chromium 3. In fact, several year ago el Sistema de Agua Potable de Le\u00f3n made a report in which it was revealed that at least 10 water wells in the region were contaminated with hexavalent chromium.\n\nLos vecinos reportan que antes de la llegada de Qu\u00edmica Central de M\u00e9xico, las localidades ten\u00edan agua muy limpia que proven\u00eda del subsuelo. Desde que se instal\u00f3 la planta, evitan tomar agua del subsuelo y tampoco riegan sus cultivos con esta agua.  Para regar sus cosechas usan el agua que proviene de la Presa el Barrial.  El municipio les lleva una pipa de agua gratuita para sus necesidades de uso dom\u00e9stico, pues se sabe que el agua de los subsuelos est\u00e1 contaminada con cromo 6 y cromo 3. De hecho, un informe del Sistema de Agua Potable de Leo\u0301n dio a conocer hace varios an\u0303os que al menos 10 pozos de agua de la regio\u0301n esta\u0301n contaminados con cromo hexavalente.\n",
