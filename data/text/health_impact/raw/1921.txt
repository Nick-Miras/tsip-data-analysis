Site Title: Huepetuhe, Manu province, Madre de Dios
Site Description: The community of Huepetuhe is impacted by gold mining, which uses mercury and hydrocarbons in the extraction process. These pollutants affect soils and rivers, which serve as a source of drinking water and food for the population.  Huepetuhe is located in the Huepetuhe District, Manu province, in the Department of Madre de Dios. This village is at approximately 1400 km from Lima, but transport is only available by air and river.  The community is located in a mountainous area with many trees, with temperatures as high as 40 degrees and torrential rain. The houses are wooden with tin roofs and are seated on wooden pillars. Other huts are made of palm branches and covered with plastic, with no walls and only one room. The population only has electricity for 4 hours a day. In the area, there are 2 primary schools and one secondary school. They have a health post, but it lacks diagnostic equipment. The population of Huepetuhe lacks safe drinking water, drainage pipes, and garbage collection services.  Near the houses, in the mountains, are various mining activities, most of which are informal and artisanal. Some of these belongs to the Inversur company.   In this place, the miners are extracting gold using many chemicals, such as mercury and hydrocarbons. The waste generated from these chemicals is disposed into the environment and now is affecting the quality of soils and rivers in the area. Mining in the area produces about 20 kg of gold per day, which annually generates over 400 tons of tailings, causing damage to the population, especially in the rainy season.  Gold mining in the area is causing great harm to the ecosystem in the Amazonian jungle. Also, as the fishes and other small organisms feed on the soil and water, mercury is accumulating in their tissue, making them a danger to eat.  The population of Huepetuhe is also affected because they use the river water for drink and irrigation. Also, 40% of the population in the area works in the mines during the weekends and during periods of rain. Moreover, people in the area have reported a high incidence of diseases such as anemia and gastric problems.                    Water, soil, air, and food.  Primarily through drinking the water and using contaminated water for irrigation.                  
Health Impacts: In 1995, the Institute of Management Water and Environment, IMA, conducted a study among miners in the area of Huepetuhe and the results were startling: 78% of 45 people tested for mercury content in their blood had levels higher than the maximum limit.
