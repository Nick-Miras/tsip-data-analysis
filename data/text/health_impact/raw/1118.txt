Site Title: Lead pollution at Ngasa-2 oil exploration well, Angara spit, Kaiso Village, Bugashya County, Hoima District
Site Description: The site is located in Kaiso Village, Kabale Parish, Bugashya Subcounty, Bugashya County in Hoima District. Ngasa-2 lies on the low-lying Kaiso-Tonya flats on a spit of land  at the shores of Lake Albert closing to is a fishing Angara lagoon.

The spectacular nature of the site attracts many tourist who enjoy fishing and the surrounding community are predominantly fishermen with limited animals. The contaminant originate from drilling cutting which are dispersed on the ground in the adjacent area.  The drilling operations are not known for using heavy metals for therefore the heavy metals present could be attributed to the addition during drilling. Two Possible sources arise: Heavy metal brought to the surface from the earth's crust or the chemicals added makes the metals available from their fixed state.  The dominant transmission path is through drinking water from community wells near the site and through direct contact from water in the lagoon used for bathing. Animals too drink the same water from the lagoon thus through the food chain.

Health Impacts: Generally the operations are recent event and given the time span limited evident on the health impacts of the heavy metals can be adduced at this stage. However considering the the pollutant is dispersed in the waters sources that are important to the community livelihood this incessant exposure of the community to the pollutant is likely to induce various health effects associated with these heavy metals.
