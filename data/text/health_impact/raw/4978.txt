Site Title: Jua Kali Informal Fabricating and Spray Painting Area, Gikomba, Nairobi
Site Description: Jua Kali is located in Nairobi’s largest market, Gikomba along latitude: -1.2916969 and longitude: 36.8426885, about 4km from Nairobi’s Central Business District. The area is generally flat and very windy. The area borders Shauri Moyo slums and Railways residential estates. Several foot paths cross the area. The local communities use piped water for drinking, industrial and domestic purposes. The area is characterized by several schools, hospitals, food kiosk and business centers.   Over 2000 (two thousand) informal fabricators in Jua Kali use chromium, lead, cadmium and mercury-contaminated paints (See attached laboratory report in Part 6) to spray vehicles, fridges, metallic boxes etc. in the densely populated Gikomba area. The workers lack safety and environmental controls while working. The sprayed paint is transported via wind and air across the surrounding environs and finally deposited on surrounding markets, soils and buildings causing widespread metal contamination. Wastes from the activities are deposited in open dumps on site. Local communities can inhale the metal-contaminated air, ingest metal-contaminated soils, dust and food. Workers are mainly exposed through direct inhalation of sprayed paint, ingestion of contaminated dust and constant direct skin contact with the paint while working. School children live and school in nearby residences and schools and are possibly exposed.               
Health Impacts: Respiratory problems were reported by most workers.
