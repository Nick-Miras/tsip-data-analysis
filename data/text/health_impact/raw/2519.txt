Site Title: Madiwala Lake,BTM 2nd Stage,Banglore,Karnataka
Site Description: Bangalore also known as Bengaluru, is the capital of the state of Karnataka. Located on the Deccan Plateau in the south-eastern part of Karnataka, Bangalore is India's third most populous city and fifth-most populous urban agglomeration.   As of 2009, Bangalore was inducted in the list of Global cities and ranked as a "Beta World City" alongside Geneva, Copenhagen, Boston, Cairo, Riyadh, Berlin, to name a few, in the studies performed by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network in 2008.  Today as a large city and growing metropolis, Bangalore is home to many of the most well-recognized colleges and research institutions in India.  Numerous public sector heavy industries, software companies, aerospace, telecommunications, and defence organisations are located in the city.   Bangalore is known as the Silicon Valley of India because of its position as the nation's leading IT exporter.  A demographically diverse city, Bangalore is a major economic and cultural hub and the fastest growing major metropolis in India.  The headquarter of several public sector undertakings such as Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL), Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML) and Hindustan Machine Tools (HMT) are located in Bangalore.   In June 1972 the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) was established under the Department of Space and headquartered in the city.  The site Madiwala lake is one of the biggest lakes in Bangalore, India spread over an area of 114.3 hectare. It is situated in the BTM Layout in Bangalore city.   It is a home to many migratory birds. The Madiwala Lake comes under the administration of Karnataka State Forest Department.  As the city's growth spiraled, the Madivala Lake was subjected to intense pollution, with the blockage of inflow channels, immersion of religious idols,encroachments into the catchment area and inflow of sewage water.   With chemical waste being dumped into the lake by neighboring industrial units every day, the water has turned acidic.(links attached)  All these had transformed the lake into a very large sewage pool. Madivala Lake, which was once, a fresh water tank, was fully covered with thick growth water hyacinth, thus preventing aeration and affecting the bio-diversity of flora and fauna.              Water  and soil are  the likely transmission pathway as the heavy metal pollution has been found in lake water and soil samples.   Water from lake is used for washing purposes,hence regular contact with human population is there.  Fish present in the lake also reports of traces of heavy metals.  The fish from lake is sold in Madiwala market;with heavy metals presence in fish samples,the same is entering the food chain,thus seriously impacting human health.  Historically lakes in the Bangalore region were managed by a plethora of government agencies such as the Forest Department, Minor Irrigation Department, Horticulture Department, Public Works Department (PWD), Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BMP), Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), Tourism Department, City Municipal Councils and Panchayats; each organization claiming its own jurisdiction of ownership and maintenance rights resulting in a deficient, inconsistent and uncoordinated approach   The Government of Karnataka, following the directive of The Honourable High Court of Karnataka and considering the unchecked deterioration of lakes in and around Bangalore and keeping in line with their critical role in maintaining healthy environs and recharging of ground water, set up the Lake Development Authority (LDA) in July 2002 as a registered society under the Karnataka Societies Registration Act, 1959, as a non-profit organization and a para–statal body with a mandate of  "working solely for the regeneration and conservation of lakes in and around Bangalore city within BMRDA jurisdiction in the first instance, would be extended to other parts of Karnataka subsequently"
