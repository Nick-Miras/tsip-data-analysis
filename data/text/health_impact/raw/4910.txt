Site Title: Ganesh Informal ULAB Recyclers, Nyamathi, Naivasha.
Site Description: Ganesh Eco Solutions is located in a residential area in Nyamathi, Naivasha in Nakuru County along latitude -0.78533 and longitude 36.522366667. Ganesh Eco Solutions has about 100 employees and neighbors several residences, Nyamathi shopping center, farms, churches and Nakuru-Nairobi highway. The area gently slopes and is very windy. Raw materials for operations in Ganesh Eco Solutions are used lead acid batteries which are recycled using crude methods, without any pollution controls. Recycling processes release large amounts of lead dust into the surrounding soils, buildings and plants. The companyâ€™s solid waste is buried in shallow pits dug within the area.  Employees in Ganesh Eco Solutions are constantly exposed to lead through direct inhalation of lead fumes and dust, ingestion of contaminated soil dust and food, and skin contact while at work. This is because they work without wearing any protective gear. Wind, surface runoffs and air are the major possible migration routes in this area. Wind blows the lead dust and lead contaminated soils across the nearby buildings, farms, shopping center and soils. School children, workers and residents in the neighborhood can inhale the lead fumes or dust from Ganesh Eco Solutions, ingest the lead-contaminated food, soil and dust.  Young children can come into skin contact with the lead or ingest the contaminated soils and dust while playing.         
Health Impacts: High blood lead levels have been recorded among local residents as evidence in blood tests conducted by a local NGO.
