Site Title: Lead pollution at Central African Batteries Manufacturers, Mashonaland West
Site Description: Central African Batteries is in Norton, a town in Mashonaland West Province of Zimbabwe. The site is at 189 Galloway Road. Norton has a population of over 20,000.   Central African Batteries is a site in the industrial area of Norton, which is low lying and flat.   The problem here stems from the pollution of the soil during battery manufacturing. The site is still active. The company has tried to recover some of the lead in the soil. However, the soil at the dumpsite still contains more than 16% lead by weight.   The local authority has not allowed Central African Batteries to dump the lead-rich soil at the dumpsites.  The contaminated soil has been left exposed on the company premises. During the rainy season, some of the lead is gradually washed into the surrounding environment.   Some of the lead is washed into the surface water river systems and some seeps into the ground. The movement of the lead from the site to the people is mainly through groundwater.  
Surrounding Central African Batteries are other industries and two residential areas, Nharira and Twinlakes, which are a kilometer or so from the site. Some of the people in these suburbs have dug shallow wells that provide the community with drinking water. Through surface and groundwater.   The site is exposed such that when there is rain some of the lead seeps into the ground and some are washed off into the environment. People who have dug shallow wells and boreholes may be affected by the lead.  During the dry season, wind exposes both children and adults to lead dust.    In addition, the workers are exposed to the lead.
