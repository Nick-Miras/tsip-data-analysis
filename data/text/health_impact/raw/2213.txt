Site Title: Guru Nanak Thermal Power Plant, Bathinda, Punjab
Site Description: Bathinda or Bhatinda (Punjabi: à¨¬à¨ à¨¿à©°à¨¡à¨¾), named after the Bhati Rajput kings, is one of the oldest cities in Punjab and the current administrative headquarters of Bathinda District. It is situated in north-western India in the Malwa (Punjab) Region. Courtesy to five artificial lakes in the city, Bathinda is also known as "The city of Lakes".Bathinda is located on the Indo-Gangetic alluvial plains. Bathinda's climate correspond to semi arid with high variation between summer and winter temperatures. Average annual rainfall is in a range of 20 - 40cm Bathinda is surrounded by 12 small and medium towns, making the city a hub of most industrial activities in the region.  Bathinda is one of the largest railway junctions of India. More lines extend from it than any other junction on the Indian Railway network. Bathinda cantonment is also said to be the largest in India. Bathinda has one of the biggest food-grain and cotton markets in India. The Multinational Corporation Pepsi processes horticultural products grown in Bathinda.  Major industries in Bathinda include, National Fertilizers Plant, two power plants: Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant and Guru Hargobind Thermal Plant(Lehra Mohabbat), Petrochemical Plants, Yarn & Textiles Plants, Citrus Fruit Belts and Sugar Mills. HMEL is building a Grassroots oil refinery in Bathinda.  Giana, Malkana Jajjal are the villages which exist in Bathinda, Punjab and due to industrial activity and excessive use of pesticide make them more prone to cancer and mental retardation. It is difficult to predict where the Uranium found in the area is coming from, but the most possible source is Thermal Power Plant . These plants are very near to these  villages and it may be possible source of uranium contamination.  The Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant ( à¨—à©à¨°à©‚ à¨¨à¨¾à¨¨à¨• à¨¦à©‡à¨µ à¨¥à¨°à¨®à¨² à¨ªà¨²à¨¾à¨‚à¨Ÿ ) at Bathinda[ is one of the three thermal power stations in Punjab (the other being at Lehra Mohabat and Ropar). It is a medium sized power station with 4 units that were started in the early 1970s and completeted in 1982. All total generate upto 440 Mw of power that meets the mammoth irrigation needs of lower Punjab.  At couple of years back the Thermal Plant's functioning, which some claim is not upto contemporary environment safety standards, has caused serious health problems, not only in Bathinda itself, but also in nearby towns and villages.  Fly ash is a particular problem.                                 Air, water, soil.  In this study, 27/113 children, who showed high uranium levels in their hair samples, live in the city of Bathinda, where the Guru Nanak Dev and Lehra Mohabbat Thermal Power Plants are.  These thermal plants produce high quantities of fly-ash from the burning of coal.  31% (almost a third) of the children tested (who are afflicted with the most severe neurological and cognitive conditions) come directly from a radius of less than 15 kms of this power plant.  More than 70% of Indiaâ€™s electricity generation is produced by coal-based thermal power plants.  The environmental impact of the coal industry and thermal power plants in Punjab can and should not be minimized or under-estimated.                   
Health Impacts: The villages in Bathinda have a high incidence of cancer, mental retardation, etc. The survey revealed that contaminated water had led to a rise in the cases of cancer, asthma, joint pain, premature greying of hair, skin diseases and, to an extent, mental impairment.
