        "description": "Central African Batteries is in Norton, a town in Mashonaland West Province of Zimbabwe. The site is at 189 Galloway Road. Norton has a population of over 20,000.   Central African Batteries is a site in the industrial area of Norton, which is low lying and flat.   The problem here stems from the pollution of the soil during battery manufacturing. The site is still active. The company has tried to recover some of the lead in the soil. However, the soil at the dumpsite still contains more than 16% lead by weight.   The local authority has not allowed Central African Batteries to dump the lead-rich soil at the dumpsites.  The contaminated soil has been left exposed on the company premises. During the rainy season, some of the lead is gradually washed into the surrounding environment.   Some of the lead is washed into the surface water river systems and some seeps into the ground. The movement of the lead from the site to the people is mainly through groundwater.  \nSurrounding Central African Batteries are other industries and two residential areas, Nharira and Twinlakes, which are a kilometer or so from the site. Some of the people in these suburbs have dug shallow wells that provide the community with drinking water. Through surface and groundwater.   The site is exposed such that when there is rain some of the lead seeps into the ground and some are washed off into the environment. People who have dug shallow wells and boreholes may be affected by the lead.  During the dry season, wind exposes both children and adults to lead dust.    In addition, the workers are exposed to the lead.                       ",

        "description": "The community of Huepetuhe is impacted by gold mining, which uses mercury and hydrocarbons in the extraction process. These pollutants affect soils and rivers, which serve as a source of drinking water and food for the population.  Huepetuhe is located in the Huepetuhe District, Manu province, in the Department of Madre de Dios. This village is at approximately 1400 km from Lima, but transport is only available by air and river.  The community is located in a mountainous area with many trees, with temperatures as high as 40 degrees and torrential rain. The houses are wooden with tin roofs and are seated on wooden pillars. Other huts are made of palm branches and covered with plastic, with no walls and only one room. The population only has electricity for 4 hours a day. In the area, there are 2 primary schools and one secondary school. They have a health post, but it lacks diagnostic equipment. The population of Huepetuhe lacks safe drinking water, drainage pipes, and garbage collection services.  Near the houses, in the mountains, are various mining activities, most of which are informal and artisanal. Some of these belongs to the Inversur company.   In this place, the miners are extracting gold using many chemicals, such as mercury and hydrocarbons. The waste generated from these chemicals is disposed into the environment and now is affecting the quality of soils and rivers in the area. Mining in the area produces about 20 kg of gold per day, which annually generates over 400 tons of tailings, causing damage to the population, especially in the rainy season.  Gold mining in the area is causing great harm to the ecosystem in the Amazonian jungle. Also, as the fishes and other small organisms feed on the soil and water, mercury is accumulating in their tissue, making them a danger to eat.  The population of Huepetuhe is also affected because they use the river water for drink and irrigation. Also, 40% of the population in the area works in the mines during the weekends and during periods of rain. Moreover, people in the area have reported a high incidence of diseases such as anemia and gastric problems.                    Water, soil, air, and food.  Primarily through drinking the water and using contaminated water for irrigation.                  ",

        "description": "Cebu City, the capital city of Cebu, is considered the second most significant metropolitan center in the Philippines. The city is located on the eastern shore of Cebu. Cebu is the Philippines' main domestic shipping port and is home to about 80 % of the country's domestic shipping companies and is a significant center of commerce, trade and industry in the Visayas and Mindanao regions. It has a population of about 2,439,005 people based on the 2007 Philippine Population census.  Cebu City has 81 barangays with a total population of 798,809 people (2007 census). Its trade and industry are based mainly on small and medium scale business enterprises and among these are Cebu Business Park and IT industries created by the Ayalas. In addition, export industries producing products such as semiconductors, electronic watches, electrical equipment, cameras and furniture are also booming in the region.  Another potential industry that may add to the economy of Cebu is the legal/formal recycling of IT materials and metals like ULAB. However, these types of industries are not yet common in the region.   For the entirety of the Visayas and Mindanao regions, there is only one registered ULAB facility, which is situated in Mandaue City. The high demand of recycling lead from ULAB has created an informal sector of ULAB recycling. Informal ULAB recycling poses hazards not only to the recyclers, but also to the community due to environmental contamination with heavy metals.  An informal ULAB recycling site was located in Sitio Tingga-an, Barangay San Nicolas, Cebu City. Barangay San Nicolas hosts 5,407 people based on 2007 Philippine Population Census, and of this, around 2000 people are possibly affected by lead and other heavy metals. According to the barangay health officer and some residents of Sitio Tingga-an, recycling is done usually within the community, by the roadside and outside of homes.   During our site visit we were able to witness the recycling done by the side of the road. Acids were directly dumped into sewers/canals and road cement. The recycling site is adjacent to a rice store/granary and opposite a school. Kids were playing in the vicinity, and many residents were eating here as well. Refreshments and other food vendors sell their products in this contaminated site.  The facility is a cottage industry in a shanty town that has operated for about 30 years, with about 40-60 families doing informal recycling over a 1 hectare area. Before that, a poultry operation was at the site. A school is across the street (about 75 meters away) with 200 elementary and 100 high school students.  There was a small old lead smelter along the street in front of the shanty town, behind a fence and a rice mill and warehouse is situated next door.  The lead is melted into pellets for buyers and used for galvanized iron sheet fasteners and to seal nail heads when nailing concrete.   According to the Barangay health officer, a health assessment was conducted by the University of the Philippines Manila about three to four years ago. Five children of those directly involved in the informal ULAB recycling and who were residing in the area for a long time were selected as respondents. Lead levels in their blood were examined and results showed that all of the respondents had blood lead levels exceeding health standards.  The DENR-EMB Region 7 and the Local Government Unit have already prohibited this economic activity. They have formed an enforcement team, but people continue ULAB recycling, as it is their source of income. There is more than one pathway. One is through the soil, as children may inhale lead dust while playing. Food contamination is also possible since sidewalk food vendors are in the vicinity. Rice stores/granaries are also present nearby thus displays of rice could be contaminated with lead dust.  Water could also be a pathway since some of the pipes for drinking water in the area are situated along these polluted canals.     ",

Lead levels in their blood were examined and results showed that all of the respondents had blood lead levels exceeding health standards.  Informal ULAB recyclers face hazards too, since they are not given personal protective gears.   The soil sample concentrations of arsenic, mercury, copper, and cadmium were compared to the United States' Centers for Disease Control minimum risk level (MRL) standards for toxic exposure. Using international standard values for the amount of soil an average weight 5 year old child ingests, calculations showed that all four metals exceeded MRL values for oral consumption of 100mg of soil for an 18.5 kg child per day. Mercury concentration just barely exceeded the MRL standard, copper had exceeded the MRL value by 3.7 times, and cadmium soil concentrations exceeded the MRL values by more than 33 times.  However, the most alarming value is of arsenic concentration, which exceeded the MRL value for chronic exposure by more than 668 times.  There are a number of limitations in these calculations, done retrospectively with the limited data available.  Primarily, this only accounts for the oral ingestion route of inadvertent soil intake by children, and no other exposure pathway (such as inhalation of fine particles.) Additionally, the average weight of children in the Philippines is likely lower than the given WHO standard.  Also, children living in this community likely eat more than just 100mg of dirt, the worldwide average value used in the calculations.  Therefore, it is likely that with sufficient data, computations would show that exposure in children is even greater than the values calculated here.  -U.S. CDC's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mrls/index.asp      ",

        "description": "The River Ravi is by far the most polluted river in Pakistan. The river gets most polluted while flowing through the regions between Lahore and Balloki. Much of the waste products are deposited in the river which contaminates its water. The river has been reduced to a channel due to the serious and heavy pollution discharges.  Ravi River flowing through both India and Pakistan originates at the Banghal basin. The river flows at a great speed through the region but is unfortunately the most polluted river in Pakistan. Ravi waters both India and Pakistan. Since its source is in India it flows through the northwestern part of Chamba and through the southwestern part of Jammu and Kashmir. Finally it reaches Pakistan to water the land of India's neighbor. The river drains a total catchment area of 14,442 square kilometers (5,576 sq mi) in India after flowing for a length of 725 kilometers (450 mi).  The Ravi valley in its upper reaches has Deodar, walnut, Quercus ilex, daphne, mulberry, alder, edible pine (Pinus gerardiana), twisted cypress (Cupressus torulosa), chinar (Platanus orientalis), daphne papyracea, cedrela serata, and sisso, olive and kakkar (raus).   According to official studies, the Ravi is the most polluted river in Pakistan. Most wastewater discharge reaches the river in a 60 km stretch between Balloki and Lahore. The Ravi is currently estimated to receive 47 percent of the total municipal and industrial discharge pumped into all rivers of Pakistan. In addition, industrial and agricultural waste from both India and Pakistan pour into the river through the Hudaira drain, which enters the Ravi on Lahore's outskirts.  As the River has died a slow and painful death, the fishing communities that for generations made a living from its waters have suffered too. The extreme pollution of the River Ravi has destroyed most of the 42 species of fish that once lived in the river, as well as the bird life around it, which has migrated to other areas. The survival of small invertebrates, micro fauna and flora is also threatened. (WWF Pakistan)  The weather of the area is extreme. Winters are very cold and summers are very hot with temperature soaring up to 40 C, but at the time of study it was pleasant. The direction of the wind  was southwards.  The Ravi has been transformed into the river of death which is playing havoc with the health of the citizens. As many as 42 species of fish have become extinct from the river. Dumping of sacrificial meat, industrial and hospital waste on the river-beds have made the situation worse. Various pathways are involved like:  drinking of contaminated water use of groundwater and surface water for drinking and irrigating children play at polluted place inhalation of polluted air",

        "description": "Bangalore also known as Bengaluru, is the capital of the state of Karnataka. Located on the Deccan Plateau in the south-eastern part of Karnataka, Bangalore is India's third most populous city and fifth-most populous urban agglomeration.   As of 2009, Bangalore was inducted in the list of Global cities and ranked as a \"Beta World City\" alongside Geneva, Copenhagen, Boston, Cairo, Riyadh, Berlin, to name a few, in the studies performed by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network in 2008.  Today as a large city and growing metropolis, Bangalore is home to many of the most well-recognized colleges and research institutions in India.  Numerous public sector heavy industries, software companies, aerospace, telecommunications, and defence organisations are located in the city.   Bangalore is known as the Silicon Valley of India because of its position as the nation's leading IT exporter.  A demographically diverse city, Bangalore is a major economic and cultural hub and the fastest growing major metropolis in India.  The headquarter of several public sector undertakings such as Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL), Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML) and Hindustan Machine Tools (HMT) are located in Bangalore.   In June 1972 the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) was established under the Department of Space and headquartered in the city.  The site Madiwala lake is one of the biggest lakes in Bangalore, India spread over an area of 114.3 hectare. It is situated in the BTM Layout in Bangalore city.   It is a home to many migratory birds. The Madiwala Lake comes under the administration of Karnataka State Forest Department.  As the city's growth spiraled, the Madivala Lake was subjected to intense pollution, with the blockage of inflow channels, immersion of religious idols,encroachments into the catchment area and inflow of sewage water.   With chemical waste being dumped into the lake by neighboring industrial units every day, the water has turned acidic.(links attached)  All these had transformed the lake into a very large sewage pool. Madivala Lake, which was once, a fresh water tank, was fully covered with thick growth water hyacinth, thus preventing aeration and affecting the bio-diversity of flora and fauna.              Water  and soil are  the likely transmission pathway as the heavy metal pollution has been found in lake water and soil samples.   Water from lake is used for washing purposes,hence regular contact with human population is there.  Fish present in the lake also reports of traces of heavy metals.  The fish from lake is sold in Madiwala market;with heavy metals presence in fish samples,the same is entering the food chain,thus seriously impacting human health.  Historically lakes in the Bangalore region were managed by a plethora of government agencies such as the Forest Department, Minor Irrigation Department, Horticulture Department, Public Works Department (PWD), Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BMP), Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), Tourism Department, City Municipal Councils and Panchayats; each organization claiming its own jurisdiction of ownership and maintenance rights resulting in a deficient, inconsistent and uncoordinated approach   The Government of Karnataka, following the directive of The Honourable High Court of Karnataka and considering the unchecked deterioration of lakes in and around Bangalore and keeping in line with their critical role in maintaining healthy environs and recharging of ground water, set up the Lake Development Authority (LDA) in July 2002 as a registered society under the Karnataka Societies Registration Act, 1959, as a non-profit organization and a para\u2013statal body with a mandate of  \"working solely for the regeneration and conservation of lakes in and around Bangalore city within BMRDA jurisdiction in the first instance, would be extended to other parts of Karnataka subsequently\"                  ",

It is situated in north-western India in the Malwa (Punjab) Region. Courtesy to five artificial lakes in the city, Bathinda is also known as \"The city of Lakes\".Bathinda is located on the Indo-Gangetic alluvial plains. Bathinda's climate correspond to semi arid with high variation between summer and winter temperatures. Average annual rainfall is in a range of 20 - 40cm Bathinda is surrounded by 12 small and medium towns, making the city a hub of most industrial activities in the region.  Bathinda is one of the largest railway junctions of India. More lines extend from it than any other junction on the Indian Railway network. Bathinda cantonment is also said to be the largest in India. Bathinda has one of the biggest food-grain and cotton markets in India. The Multinational Corporation Pepsi processes horticultural products grown in Bathinda.  Major industries in Bathinda include, National Fertilizers Plant, two power plants: Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant and Guru Hargobind Thermal Plant(Lehra Mohabbat), Petrochemical Plants, Yarn & Textiles Plants, Citrus Fruit Belts and Sugar Mills. HMEL is building a Grassroots oil refinery in Bathinda.  Giana, Malkana Jajjal are the villages which exist in Bathinda, Punjab and due to industrial activity and excessive use of pesticide make them more prone to cancer and mental retardation. It is difficult to predict where the Uranium found in the area is coming from, but the most possible source is Thermal Power Plant . These plants are very near to these  villages and it may be possible source of uranium contamination.

It is a medium sized power station with 4 units that were started in the early 1970s and completeted in 1982. All total generate upto 440 Mw of power that meets the mammoth irrigation needs of lower Punjab.  At couple of years back the Thermal Plant's functioning, which some claim is not upto contemporary environment safety standards, has caused serious health problems, not only in Bathinda itself, but also in nearby towns and villages.  Fly ash is a particular problem.                                 Air, water, soil.  In this study, 27/113 children, who showed high uranium levels in their hair samples, live in the city of Bathinda, where the Guru Nanak Dev and Lehra Mohabbat Thermal Power Plants are.  These thermal plants produce high quantities of fly-ash from the burning of coal.  31% (almost a third) of the children tested (who are afflicted with the most severe neurological and cognitive conditions) come directly from a radius of less than 15 kms of this power plant.  More than 70% of India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electricity generation is produced by coal-based thermal power plants.  The environmental impact of the coal industry and thermal power plants in Punjab can and should not be minimized or under-estimated.                   ",
