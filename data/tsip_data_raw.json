Pollution by dust (containing heavy metals) from the mining mills is one of the main problems, and could be affecting the health of the population that is in close proximity to these mills; likewise, these powders could be deteriorating the architectural assets with historical significance, leaving at risk cultural and intangible heritage. Arsenic is naturally present in these mines, but industrial activity disperses it in large quantities to the population.

El arsénico esta de forma natural en estas minas pero la actividad industrial lo dispersa en grantes cantidades hacia la poblacion. El arsenico fue elegido como Key Pollutant dado que es el contaminante con niveles por encima de los recomendados en la mayoría de las muestras tomadas.

Introduction Mercury (Hg) is a toxic pollutant, which is distributed world- wide from both natural and anthropogenic sources, and cannot be broken down in the environment (Li et al., 2009a; Jaeger et al., 2009). Mercury has a residence time of 1–2 years in the atmosphere, which allows it to be transported over long distances &#8657; Corresponding authors.

This district contains the town of Cantumarca which is the oldest area or the first urbanization of the Villa Imperial. Many years before the discovery of Cerro Rico, work began on the Porco silver mines, and passing through Cantumarca was an obligatory step to reach this mining center. The town is currently the subject of severe mining pollution. In the area of Cantumarca, there is the San Miguel tailings dam, which was formed from the waste left by the Velarde sugar mill for 45 years and which has been paralyzed since 1985. With the wind, the dust coming from the tailings dam is blown towards the surrounding houses. Likewise, leachates are generated in the rainy season. Currently several mining companies (mining mills) are operating in district 20 of the Municipality of Potosí, a much smaller amount is operating in district 8 (considered central zone of the city). The minerals that are being worked by the cooperative members are antimony, copper, tin, silver, lead and zinc. Most mining mills are located in residential areas very close to schools, schools, hospitals, sports fields, recreation spaces and public spaces in general. Pollution by dust (containing heavy metals and arsenic) from the mining mills is one of the main problems, and could be affecting the health of the population that is in close proximity to these mills; likewise, these powders could be deteriorating the architectural assets with historical significance, leaving an important cultural patrimony at risk.   El distrito 20 se encuentra en la zona sur (zona baja) de la ciudad de Potosí; en éste distrito se encuentra la población de Cantumarca que es la zona más antigua o la primera urbanización de la Villa Imperial. Muchos años antes del descubrimiento del Cerro Rico se iniciaron los trabajos en las minas de plata de Porco, y Cantumarca fue un paso obligado para llegar a este centro minero y actualmente es presa de una severa contaminación minera. En la zona de Cantumarca se encuentran  el dique de colas San Miguel que se formó con las cargas que salieron del ingenio Velarde durante 45 años y que desde 1985 se encuentra paralizado. Con el viento, el polvo proveniente del dique de colas es arrastrado hacia las viviendas circundantes, asimismo se generan lixiviados en época de lluvias.  Actualmente varias empresas mineras (ingenios mineros) se encuentran operando en el distrito 20 del Municipio de Potosí, una cantidad mucho menor se encuentra operando en el distrito 8 (considerado zona central de la ciudad); los minerales que están siendo trabajados por los cooperativistas son antimonio, cobre, estaño, plata, plomo y zinc.  La mayoría de los ingenios mineros se encuentran en zonas residenciales muy cerca de colegios, escuelas, hospitales, campos deportivos, de recreación y espacios públicos en general.  La contaminación por polvo (con contenido de metales pesados) proveniente de los ingenios mineros es uno de los principales problemas, y podría estar afectando a la salud de la población que se encuentra en lugares muy próximos a dichos ingenios; así mismo, éstos polvos podrían estar deteriorando los bienes arquitectónicos con significación histórica, quedando en riesgo el patrimonio cultural e intangible de la humanidad.

Miners use metallic mercury to trap fine gold dust from ore.

With a population of 1,062,300 (2010 Census preliminary results), Ufa is one of the largest cities in Russia.

In 1990 a phenol spill at the Khimprom herbicide plant leaked into Ufa's drinking water supply. Under public pressure, they started turning off the factory activity, and in the early 2000s, the plant was shut down. Soil samples taken in 2010 from 10 wells at the plant have shown that dioxin is still present in large quantities on the surface of the soil - up to 10 000 nanograms per kilogram. There are no dioxin standarts in Russia.In the USA allowed not more than 100 nanograms of dioxin per kilogram. The most dangerous thing for the city in this situation is that the groundwater in the area of of the plant lie shallowly, at a distance of 1-3 meters below the surface, which means that it remains a threat of dioxin pollution and further spread from the plant. Near the territory is an unauthorized landfill of industrial waste, where dioxins in the soil also exceed the allowable international standards.  Source of dioxins and other contaminants are the tailings pond and sludge beds, which store 500 000-550 000 m3 of sludge and lime sludge containing dioxin from 5 to 10 kg.

The source of the key pollutant is identified in the application of pesticides in Guasca through nebulizer stations and individual dispersing pumps. In this way, the routes of exposure include water intake, dermal contact with either soil or water and inhalation of dust (directly from pesticides during applications or soil dust). The remains of these pesticides are dispersed and contaminate biotic systems (such as animals and plants) and abiotic (such as soil, air and water), representing a public health hazard. The way these compounds migrate through the environment in Guasca can be given by wind transport according to the application form, surface runoff due to slope at some sampled sites, soil washing and disposal in bodies of water. Some pesticides can accumulate in the tissues of organisms (bioaccumulation), which makes them more persistent and can scale the trophic chain (biomagnification) and are not easily degraded. When coming into contact with the human, the most important alterations to consider are: reproductive problems, cancer, disorders of the neurological system, effects on the immune system, alterations of the endocrine system.      En Guasca se hace uso de pesticidas para el control de plagas en los cultivos de tipo agrícola y forestal, principalmente de la familia química de los organofosforados, siendo este el contaminante clave de sospecha de contaminación en suelos y agua de ese municipio, debido a la alta persistencia caractrística de estos componentes. La fuente del contaminante clave se identifica en la aplicación de pesticidas en Guasca a través de estaciones nebulizadoras y bombas dispersadoras individuales. De esta manera, entre las vías de exposición, se encuentran la ingesta de agua, contacto dérmico ya sea con suelo o agua e inhalación de polvos (directamente de pesticidas durante las aplicaciones o polvos de suelo). Los restos de estos plaguicidas se dispersan y contaminan los sistemas bióticos (como animales y plantas) y abiótico (como el suelo, aire y agua), representando un peligro de salud pública. La forma como estos compuestos migran a través del ambiente en Guasca puede darse por desplazamiento del viento de acuerdo con la forma de aplicación, escurrimiento superficial debido a la pendiente en algunos puntos muestreados, lavado de suelos y disposición en cuerpos de agua. Algunos pesticidas pueden acumularse en los tejidos de los organismos (bioacumulación), lo cual los hace más persistentes y pueden escalar la cadena trófica (biomagnificación) y no son fácilmente degradados.
